You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We’re drifting
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
We’re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We’re lifted
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too? The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
 




And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I’m next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land

It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land

Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue

So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah

And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you

When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like

We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say "Hey what's new?"
I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you’re wearing



She’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need

Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)

For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover? It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING! I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now? Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home" I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But  it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now

Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
Igh! I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away

And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m-
I’m drowning in the oceans you made

When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on

So live life like you’re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet now

I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest against
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again

I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, for

This is start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you One, two, three, four

Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh no

My heart’s against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love


Yeah, I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
Falling in love Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

Love me, love me

Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now... If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved You’re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you (You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you One, two, three

Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on

And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, now it seems you loved me too I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother

I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm

I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh

I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need that smile and your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
And you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Hm, you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

Now, these words I say mean you’re so amazing
And I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe
These words I say mean you’re so amazing
But I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so... I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home


And we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
But darling I, I will keep you warm
Oh darling I, I will keep you warm
Darling I, I take you home We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?

And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, whoa I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

When I see my future, it is with you
And we’ll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we’ll get there

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it

If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be

All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal

If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the wrong
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York

Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York

It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New York When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you Nah nah nah nah nah

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home" Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona

Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño (Barcelona)
Mamacita, rica
Sí tú, te adoro, señorita (Barcelona)
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida
Siempre vida Barcelona Bibia be ye ye

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye

Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye) I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't've let you go

Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill Waking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah

And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)

I don't like nobody but you, it's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah

'Cause I don't care (Don't care)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (Disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (Maybe I'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (With the bad nights)
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near (Me near)
You can take me anywhere (Anywhere, anywhere)
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
(I'm loved by somebody, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah

You done knocked me right off of my feet

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Feels, yeah
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' real
Baby, I got the feels for ya Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul

I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)

Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off a light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Dang
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, Whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
Know my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Uh, uh)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones con flow)

Mommy, I usually get scared, but today I drink alcohol, uh
I want to tell you that I don't know what happened, uh
Since we both left in the afternoon
To kiss each other both, even to make love
Now I have your scent, come to the room
What we both do, can not be matched
We look like fiction, when we go into action
This love movie, I don't know how to stop, yeah
But what kills
It that tonight we see each other, and in my house
And I know what you like and what catches you
That I tell you that I'm not going to let you go

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
Know my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

Yuh, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I got a Land Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she a Fashion Nova
Under my persona, when had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the match in loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
Know my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

She was like "Dang
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Dang
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man?
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Dang
And you ain't got nothing on you" Ayy, I waited for you all day

I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know

I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)

Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her

And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—

First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around

Türküm - BEAST I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close
DEVLIN
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be
The times i'm living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die
DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4
The times i'm living in lately Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out?"
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?

Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
Oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out
You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?
I'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out

This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Now an angel will die, covered in white
With losed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday

And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING! I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you

Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, fly!

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man, yeah

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
Fly on

Just send up my love, ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone
Anyone, ah yeah
Oh
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh-ho-ho
Woo, yeah
I said get down with it, babe
I want you to shh...
Right down now, right down now
Ah...
Oh... get on now
Get on up now The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Val-hala
Val-hala
Val-hala It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection

And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea

The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand

And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there

Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough

Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover

Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will, we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
Oh Lady, what's tomorrow I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room

While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails

Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich

While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand

Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun
 
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer

Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun
 
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behind When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hills
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave
 
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears

The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have
 
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
She sheds only tears
She sheds only tears The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me that I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains Hey there
Look in the mirror
Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
Waiting, waiting at windows
Oh it's me that you need
Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you

But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world

And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need

Watching, watching the swallows fly
It all means the same
Just like them
You can fly home again
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
Pride is an ugly word girl
And you still know my name

But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world

And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away
 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain
 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

Did you paint your smile on, well, I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

Well, I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Or he may be she
What I'm told is never, never for certain

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Yeah, yeah, take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise

Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise
Oh yeah

All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
Yeah, I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them

Yeah, so ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, oh, yeah
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, yeah, oh I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you

For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other


The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where ever you are
I am who I am
You are who you are

Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman Who'll walk me down to church
When I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me
Has been ten years in the grave
And señorita play guitar
Play it just for you
My rosary has broken
And my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and
You've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in
Wasn't too much fun

And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on

Yes, I'll sit with you and talk
Let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers
Would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ
Plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low
When you are passing through

And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction, and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes, oh
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

Holy Moses, let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there, what's his color? I don't care
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us, let us live in peace Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent's smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

Well, I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Oh-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die

Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me, yeah
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in?
Should I cry sanctuary?

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die, yeah!
The king must die
The king must die, oh, yeah

No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
The king is dead
The king is dead
The king is dead
The king is dead

Long live the king It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well, don't you try to stop me, I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows
(Rock on, baby!)
(Whoo! Yeah, yeah)

Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Let's get a little bit lower
Let's get a little bit lower
Oh, you're standing alright
Single, baby? Ah, yeah, that's pretty good
Now, is everybody gonna rock on with me?
One more time

I said, that's my rock and roll Madonna, aw, everybody
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, but no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows, yeah I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And I hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord, I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun


Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Lord, I say now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Lord, I say, now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
And I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Well, I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

There are women, women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home

Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying across the sticks
The hedgehogs done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chairs are creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home
Oh, country comforts in a truck that's going back home, yes, it is
Country com-comforts in a truck that's going back home "I'll catch the tram line in the morning
With your leave", Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said, "You'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm"
Van Bushell saw a hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said, "Now calm you down, my brother
Let's discuss this man to man"
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage

You're the son of your father
You try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you

With blood and water, bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own

Well, slowly Joseph barely lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell, he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said, "Now, hey, blind man, that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride"
Well, Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said, "Let me just refresh your mind
Your manners, boy, seem hard to find"



Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt

You're the son of your father
Oh, try a little bit harder
You gotta do for me as he would do for you


You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own, yeah From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

(The riverboat sails tonight)
(That's just fine alright)
Oh, slip us a rope
Sail on round, sail on round, sail on round, sail on round
(Sail)
Sail on round the bend
(The riverboat sails tonight)
Oh, I said
That's just fine alright I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range


I took myself a blue canoe The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? Lately, I've been thinking
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak

Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting, eating
Apples in the evening
The fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

Oh, if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder, whoa
The window's wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore, whoa
Are playing in the valley
Oh, I miss you, Amoreena
Like the king bee misses honey

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

Lately, I've been thinking, oh
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Oh, brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, whoa
Like a puppy, like a puppy, child, oh Why hello, say can I buy you another glass of beer?
Well, thanks a lot, that's kind of you, it's nice to know you care
These days there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
I may be just an old soldier to some
But I know how it feels to grow old

Yeah, that's right, you can see me here most every night
You'll always see me staring at the walls and at the lights
Funny, I remember, oh, it's years ago, I'd say
I'd stand at that bar with my friends who passed away
And drank three times the beer that I can drink today
Yes, I know how it feels to grow old

I know what they're saying son
There goes old man Joe again
Well, I may be mad at that I've seen enough
To make a man go out his brains
Well, do they know what it's like to have a graveyard as a friend
'Cause that's where they are, boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again, yeah

Well, it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see you next time I'm passing through
You're right there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others
You got your memories
You got your memories You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me?
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn, down the mission walls

Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah
With the sun behind my back
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago
The day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice
Of the things they've had to say
And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be
I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not that guy, or so it seems
To fill my old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life
The kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail
And tied up in their chains
Oh it's hard and I can't see
What they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think
I should step into the old man's shoes I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady

You had a busy day today Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around

Oh, it must be hard for the likes of you
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home

Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, and looking for a place, to lay down

And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

I love your Razor Face
I love your Razor Face
Ooh, I love Razor Face
Love your Razor Face
I did love your Razor Face
I love your Razor Face I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well

Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water As I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns
Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?
I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

Oh, I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
And the room service closed about an hour ago We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
And yesterday is but a long long ways away
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed

I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

There ain't no green grass in the U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life

Oh, I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the
Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun If it came to pass
That they should ask
What could I tell them?
Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul And now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain
And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs
For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon
I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Oh, get back, honky cat, get back
Get back, honky cat, whoo
Oh yeah, redneck ways and
Whoo Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow

It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed

And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right

Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time


Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are?
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues


On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself
Suicide
What a scandal if I die
Suicide
Headline news
On the state of teenage blues I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her, yeah

I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah

Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man, rocket man
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man, rocket man
Burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man, rocket man

This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed

It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel 'round
And free you from yourself


It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand

What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
Oh, it's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation There's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand
Oh, we've got to free our brothers from their shackles, yeah, if we can, if we can

Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, oh, she cries
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh, he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town
Oh, I swear one day i'm gonna burn the whorehouse to the ground, to the ground

Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come
That may free our families, free our families and our sons, and our sons
It may lay green lands to barren waste, all to waste, all to waste
Oh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face, oh, to face

Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same

Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy


Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

I'm beaten on the streets because I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle, you see

Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown

Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got a Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way

Slave Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much

Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

Oh God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean, she's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me
It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration for my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane
Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
I have to write a letter, ooh
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention on some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees
Oh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances, I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing
Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you There's a fly in the window, a dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too

Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand



Elderberry wine Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we got to go west on that bus

And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Going to go west to the sea
The greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me

Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we got to go west on that bus Walk a mile in my tennis shoes
Tina Turner gave me the highway blues
But I don't love nobody but you honey
I'm true rat for the things I done
Second cousin to a son of a gun
I'm going to wipe out your mama if she puts me on honey

Because I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't going to lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

Long haired ladies well they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
But, I don't think those ladies they really mind honey
I still don't know why you hate me so
A little bit of fun never stopped no show
Well I just want to loosen up my soul honey


Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh, it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Ooh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend" Well there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross legged with my old guitar
It kind of makes me feel like a rock and roll star
Well it makes me laugh Lord it makes me cry
And I think for once let me just get high
Let me get electric put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun

And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive going to know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm going to be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol that's what I'm gonna be

Well life is short and the world is rough
And if you're going to boogie boy you got to be tough
Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
I just drink myself to sleep each night
And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
If I make it big let me stay on top
You got to cut me loose from this one room dive
Put me on the ladder keep this boy alive

And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive going to know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm going to be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol that's what I'm gonna be I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red

So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddamit you're all going to die

How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm going to quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

I remember when rock was young

Holding hands and skimming stones

La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life
They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use
At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane
They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you
I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear
He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like you Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goosecreek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead
Go jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
Heard you coming and he got his gun
Better go jack-rabbit better start to run
Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight I lived in a tenement six floors above
I lent you my records and I lent you my love
But you left me on the weekend without a by-your-leave
That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean
But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always set those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from
You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again
It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceiling Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behind {Funeral for a Friend}

{Love Lies Bleeding}
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, the Jets, the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal When she gets up in the morning
It's enough to wake the dead
Oh she turning on the radio
And dancing on my head
It's no good living in the sun
Playing guitar all day
Boogalooing with my friends
In that erotic way

Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright
So do it in Jamaica
Got plenty for you and me
Honky tonking with my baby
In that deep blue sea

Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby, you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well, their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blueprint for all of your B-films
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, oh, with the knives in their eyes
Oh, their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned
If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright
So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Forget us, we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said
So as she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs

I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she, let me tell you now
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Oh ho
Ah ho!
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Dirty little girl (girl)
Oh ho (oh ho)
Dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Oh, oh, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
You know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday
Oh, they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go

But what do you expect from a 16-year-old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
Oh, don’t you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
A heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down

I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Somebody help me because the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away

I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me


Oh, your sister can't surf but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright, whoo Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and I have a heart of gold
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

I'm a genuine example of a social disease Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ah-ah! I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back (oh)

Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back (oh)

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh
(Oh)


I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back

Bitch, bitch, bitch is back I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent
Upon your feather pillow
For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing

Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
For there's toast and honey
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
Oh it's ten below zero
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees
My little boat she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind Oh ma cameo molesting

Common lap kitch sardin a poor floundin I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore
But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch'll do instead

City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie

Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
If they catch you, oh oh oh it could turn out bad
It's a show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic
I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune
I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth
It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control
Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawling around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf

Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think

Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound


Some mole hill mother sauntered by
Acting like the ace of spades
Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me
When I'm living on the eggs she laid I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me "An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school reports
"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died
At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win"
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

"Now you'll never get to Heaven" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head "they mean to do you harm"

"Don't ever ride on the devil's knee" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule
Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
"Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high"
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

"You've slept too long in silence" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)

Even on my usual table, he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to him Ooh she said, "The crowd just loved you
My name's Angel and I'm sixteen
I really love your band and your funny accent
Sure would like a cruise in your limousine."
Then she said, "How about a rubdown?
You're so cute and I'm so mean
The way you hold your guitar really gets me
I can show you tricks that you ain't never seen."
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
"Hey man, how's about a handout
All you dudes just loaded down
Just a little sugar man, makes me sweeter
I like to sit at home and watch the world go 'round."
Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh oh, Sick City
Sick City
Sick City
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah) Your life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end
Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground
Years rolling by just like a dream (ooh)
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone (ahh)
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone (ahh)
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end Welcome to my Christmas song

Steppin' into Christmas with me

Step into Christmas, let's join together

Step into Christmas, the admission's free, oh

(Ah) Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?"

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning

For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die?

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied? There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
Mmm, He's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me, I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs a-hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling, she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare
Of undue concern, he said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember?
Can I still shoot a fast cue?
Has this country kid still got his soul?

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight) I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner
In the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Ooh! Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims and the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain, no regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so?
Ain't that so?

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Meal ticket


(Gotta get a meal ticket)

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well, they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease-streaked windows of an all-night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say "inspired"
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh
Ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh (la, la, la)
Ah
Ah
La-la-la-la-la...

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead Is there anything left?
Maybe steak and eggs
Waking up to washing up
Making up your bed
Lazy days
My razor blade
Could use a better edge
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft
I know you
And you know me
It's always half and half

And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"


And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh
We all fall in love sometimes I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Oh...
Oh...

Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waitin' to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh You are my weakness
You are my friend
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
When we're together
Or when we're apart
There's never a space in-between
The beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree

One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you (wooh)

You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I am the bee

One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you
One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you (wooh) I used to be a rollin' stone, you know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee--high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
Yes, I do

If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (Some people choose the city)
Some others choose the good old family home
(Some others choose the good old family home)
I like livin' easy without family ties ('Livin easy)
Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya, yes I do

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me
I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
You know I lo-o-ove ya, yeah
You know I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!

(Philadelphia freedom)
I lo-o-ove you, yes I do, Philadelphia freedom
You know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Oh, don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do! Yell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help
Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help
Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm
Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help
I wish tonight wasn't wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of july (yell help)
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight (x2)
Well i met this woman down in new orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell i don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive
On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So i better yell help

Yell Help! Can you tell me how old Dan might've done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might've been read on the planet Mars
'Cause I don't have foresight to see
If we'll still be together in the twenty-first
In the twenty-first century, oh no

He's our flyin' ace, Pilot of the Future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
'Cause I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny, oh no

So long, Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long, yeah

Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

Oh, so long, Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long

Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

Dan Dare doesn't know it
Doesn't know it, doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it
Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

(Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it)
(Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it)
(Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it)
(Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it) I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey, so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standin' six-foot-three
Turnin' tricks for the dudes in the big city

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

Well, she's black as coal, but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well-worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
Oh, he one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it, I thought I died last night
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, he was so macho

And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous

Well, I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray just to see if He would comprehend
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, and it hurt so much

And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous
Ya know, I think I really like...

I'll grow some funk
Yea, I'll grow some funk of my own
Oh, I'll grow some funk
I'll grow some funk of my own
I'll grow some funk
Of my own
Of my own
Of my own
Of my own
I'll grow some funk
I'll grow some funk Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford

Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law  They must've had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand
I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance
Then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an east end gang

And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
Ooh, if we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away
From the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers
Yeah, and I was born to sin

And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids


Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Making news just being around Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out, I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men

How I've struggled for my money, sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey, Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while

All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

I never seem to look at you, and see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long, let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt

Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While i persist i'm putting out the fire

All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
Because you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl


All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife Don't close the shades, I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade, inches from madness
Don't let me sleep here, they're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving, they've all heard me screaming, screaming

Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
Because I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me

The room's so distorted, and filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass, white like a marrow bone
It all seems so long ago, I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream, I saw the red light flashing, flashing


Feed me Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old billy bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking

Check It out, check it out, check it out

And when I'm dead who'll fly the white bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
Because billy bones just wants to know who'll fly the white bird home


Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the bosun cry
Old billy bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide
 x2


Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart Tonight, do we have to fight again?
Tonight, I just wanna go to sleep
Turn out the light, but you wanna carry grudges
Oh, nine times outta ten, I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling

Tonight, does it have to be the old thing?
Tonight, oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise, ooh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time

Tonight, just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight, why not approach with less defiance?
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile tonight

Tonight, just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight, why not approach with less defiance?
The man who'd love to see you smile
The man who'd love to see you smile
The man who'd love to see you smile tonight Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
Because progress here, don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal
So, there's not a great deal of crime

It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair, just picking a tune

And they aren't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
But if you want to hear Susanna, then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night

Because it's no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal cause there's simply nothing much around The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise
To see you very much alive in the English rain again

And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy?
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child

I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers



Chameleon  Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
And justice needs and justice wants

But just in times, yes, too late here
Oh, feels like I wasn't born there
(Feels like I wasn't born there)
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim, oh, huh, yeah

Boogie Pilgrim, hustled to get it, to get it together
Down on the jive talk, down on the weather
Boogie Pilgrim, oh, brother I never felt better
No, I never felt better

Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
Oh, I got the speed, baby, you got the need, ah,uh

But the need in me needs nothing
(But you know that I need nothing)
But I know that you all want something
Oh, just like Boogie Pilgrim, Boogie Pilgrim


Yeah, I know I'm better
(Don't you know that I never felt better)
No, I'm never, never, never felt better
(Don't you know that I never felt better)
Don't you know that I never felt better 

Boogie, Boogie, Boogie Pilgrim, yeah
Oh, lord I never felt better, yeah
(Don't you know that I never felt better)
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo

Yeah
(You know that I never felt better)

Boogie Pilgrim Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Because she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful fans who'd miss her On a bench, on the beach just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you, plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean
Before light shook the sky, down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand, it's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away from hungry hands, from hungry hands

Crazy water takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray for the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me, ooh, separating you and me


Crazy water

In the crazy, crazy water
In the crazy, crazy, crazy water
Crazy, crazy, crazy water Now, it was just like Frankie and Johnny
And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl
From a mid-west family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at sears
She had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years
But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler
By the name of Candy floss
They'd slipped town on a late night train
Heading for the west
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her mustang
With a piece between her breast

She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster
You can never, never tell if the Law's about

If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across the country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
An venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park
But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone


You can never, never tell if the Law's about  What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me?
Oh, what have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I gotta do?
What have I gotta do?
Ooh, and sorry seems to be the hardest word I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

And if I shower around 3 a.m
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray



Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King

For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season, erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed


Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing
Daughters of some different age He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote, "oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living
To go on living
Living life this way"

"And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're gonna take the news
But if I had my life again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody, I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes"

"Oh
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers
And I've drunk myself sober
After hours and hours"
"Oh
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
(It's not the same)
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers (oooh)
And I've drunk myself sober (oooooh)
After hours and hours"
"Oooooooh
After hours and hours" Shoorah 

She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind, she's simple and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children and she's been my lover
No no no no, no no, she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten, you get excited
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mama, she really likes her
She comes for coffee, and my mama asked me

So where's the shoorah she sang?
You know I hear it again, my friend
Where's the shoorah, she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
Because she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah she sang?
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah she sang?

Shoorah



Oh, Shoorah
Shoorah Torn from their families
Mothers go hungry
To feed their children
But children go hungry
There's so many big men
They're out making millions
When poverty's profits
Just blame the children

If there's a God in heaven
What's he waiting for?
If he can't hear the children
Then he must see the war
But it seems to me
That he leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land

Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears
There's so many crying
But so few that hear


If there's a God in heaven
Well, what's he waiting for? Oh, he was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him to the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them

Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before

He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized
In the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share
Alright

Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Strobe light on funky feet
Soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

Chicago, L.A
Everyplace, everyway
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Illinois, Santa Fe
Do do do do do do do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
 
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance Oh my love
I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through 

Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill

Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on you It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call

Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise

The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart


I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise again I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin
I got holes where the rain gets in
I got you and that's enough for me

I don't care, I don't care 
I don't care, long as I got your love

Clothes that are falling apart
I got a car that refuses to start
I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks
He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more
Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper
And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours
Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper It isn't going to be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind
It isn't going to be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be easy and that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It isn't easy to put it back again
It isn't going to be easy to forget
Now you've been seeing a man that I am not met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You got to play your cards or fold a losing hand

And it isn't going to be easy and that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart

It isn't going to be easy, it isn't going to be easy



It isn't going to be so from the start
It isn't going to be easy from the start
It isn't going to be isn't going to be easy be so easy
Easy easy easy easy easy easy yeah
It isn't going to be so easy

It isn't going to be so easy from the start, you got my heart
And it isn't going to be so easy from the start
It isn't going to be so easy from the start
It isn't going to be so easy easy from the start
Even from the start Part-time love is bringin' me down
'Cause I just can't get it started with you, my love
Did I hear you sayin' that I'm too hard-hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part-time love

You've been seen runnin' around
There's not much I don't a-hear of, and a-still, you try
Tellin' me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doin' it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part-time love

Fallin', I'm fallin', can't get free
Baby, if you keep on stallin'
Oh, how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part-time love

Part-time love
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction with you, my love
Whatever I do, you raise the same objection
Now, I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part-time love

I'm waitin', I'm waitin' all the time
And it's gettin' so frustratin'
Love, well it ain't no crime
Because you, me and everybody needs a part-time love
No, you, me and everybody's got a part-time love
No, you and me and everybody needs a part-time love
You, me, everybody got a part-time love When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still isn't quite enough

Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest


Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die  I'm still in love with you, oh, shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star
You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh, you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far, oh, shooting star
And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star
And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are

Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold gray light, someone sees a shadow
Run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done, they listen
To the final countdown begun, three, two, one
Madness, it's a kind of madness
That turns good men bad
And we're helpless, caught up
In the madness of a world gone mad
The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear, a hopeless cry for help
But no one is near enough to hear
As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives they try to fight the flame
But nothing survives of all those lives

And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain

And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart
And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul, madness Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything

Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything

Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything

Life, life, life, life
Life, life, life, life, life, life Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
'Cause I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I will amaze before the light I crave the light
Blinding white I need the light tonight
Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
'Cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight
Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face
Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I had to grow and prove my ego
Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
Oh 'cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight
Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face
Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
Childish (childish), foolish (foolish), before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I, I had to grow to prove my ego Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He got trouble but he ain't got joy
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
He got trouble and he ain't got joy
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah
Well Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover
When someone told a lie
Jo Jo his lover, he'd been cheating on him
Shouldn't he know why
Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover
When someone let him down
Jo Jo his lover, he'd been cheating on him
He'd been messing around This house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason
Then someone shot through the tyre swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season
And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's tought to survive
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll
But he has to tremble
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing I've been blown away like a printed page
That reads "you're lovesick"
Headline news had me so abused
But I was lovesick
You never tried although I sacrificed
My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too
I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says he's lovesick
I can't explain why I'll never change
This sickness deep inside
I've been doctored down, I've had the nurse around Two people caught on a string
A high-wire act above the center ring
While the audience is wondering
If we'll make it back
Two people up on a wire
Overhead and under fire
While the audience enquire
If it's just a knack
Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part
Where we find we're strangers
We were strangers from the start
Two people caught in the tide
On the edge of love and pride
And both afraid to approach the side
And fall again
Two people playing the part
But which is life and which is art
And isn't it a little late Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go go Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play
His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight City boy, city girl
Arm in arm in our city world
A lot of love, a lot of hope
Hope our love don't go up in smoke
I feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine

Warm love in a cold world
Hope we're going to make it

Warm love in a cold world
Girl we got to make it

Warm love in a cold world
Sure we're going to make it
We're going to make it

Never knew, but thanks to you
I'm finding out just what love can do
You picked me up, I've come alive
I'm seeing life in another light
Feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine You've been crying
And there isn't no use denying
It was me
Who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's going to change me
Baby, that's the way I am
I was born bad
Always been the same, yes I was born bad
Never gonna change cause I was born bad
Only me to blame cause I was born bad
Yes I was born bad
Always been my habit, I was born bad
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad
Always going to happen, I was born bad
Because I was born bad
I mistreat you
And you know I always cheat you
But that's me
And that's the it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am Isn't no loving tonight
My woman says she isn't my woman
I sure put up a fight
To keep it right
I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
And said she's free

Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again

Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's going to rain harder this time

Thunder, thunder

Out here searching the streets
I got to find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat
But she cheated me
I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late
She's gone away Night life, hot spot light
I've got to make them dance tonight

I know that the competition's heavy
I know that these guys are cool
But I'll show this kid is more than ready
I sure got something to prove
Right now I'm just another guy
I don't mean nothing to them
But when they see me dance
When they see me dance


Right now the music's moving higher
I feel them stepping up the beat
These shoes will set the floor on fire
Everybody on your feet
You thought that you'd seen the best
Well I can tell you, forget the rest
When you see me dance Street guys, walking, dancing
Sidewalk, music, hot thing
They got their boxes tuned into their favorite show
As they truck on down the road
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie
Street boogie
Street boogie
Street boogie

Traffic, skater, rolling
Sharing, music, sure thing
He got his shoulder holster turned a way up loud
As he wheels his way around
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Catch the sound, catch the sound, catch the sound

Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me

Boogie, street boogie

Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie

Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me

Is this a game?
Are you just playin'?
Will I be losin' you?

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

My friends warned me about ya
I laughed, how could I doubt your love?
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be

So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well, I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only usin' me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown

Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock 'em
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing them 'round
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout "Hey, I'm chasing the crown"

Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips when the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown (Hey)
(Hey)


I'm chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown


I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, I've confused maps, chasing the crown
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock 'em
Made them float, made them drown, chasing them 'round
I built a wall, I built a wall in China
I'm chasing the crown Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie)I'm so in love, I'm so in love You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade

Sing it
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more

You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

Don't you want to play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed


Don't you want to play this game

When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe, let's call that quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed, sing it


Don't you want to play no more Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line
But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried

Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold

But where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Two rooms at the end of the world Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder
High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder

And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say

White powder, white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again

White powder
(White powder)
White lady
(White lady)
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house, won't you?
And hit this boy again

Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
Entertaining white powder
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder



I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder



White powder
White lady
(White lady)
Hit this boy again Dear God, are you there
Can you hear me, do you care
Dear God, here are we
Less than perfect, far from free

Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for

Dear God, now's the time
If you're listening, show some sign
Dear God, hear me plead
Don't desert us in our need
Dear God, lend a hand
Is this really what you planned
Dear God, in you we trust
Though we've failed you, don't fail us

Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God

I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Light up our way dear God, dear God
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God Never meant to be so friendly
Never made the room look nice
Never heed a word of warning
Never take my own advice
I got a brand-new problem
Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
I been in love three times this week
I'm just about to fall again

I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love, again
I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love
I'm never going to fall in love, again

Never meant to be so sexist
It's so hard to overcome
Trying hard to fight the feeling
Lechery can be such fun
Because everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on

Because everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back
If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back

Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back

If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me back You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, because
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again
You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in
Months of watching
And hours of hoping
That you'd want me
When you see me again
For I am an eagle
But my wings are all tied up
You got the power
To fly me again

So, give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love
Give me the key to your heart

You've been trying
To build walls all around you
But you're lying
Because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying
To capture that feeling
But you're chasing
What you've never believed in


Tell me you love me
Tell me you need me I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out
I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine
I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You got to go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You got to give if you want to get
And I want all you got I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game
If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
Because I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again

My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
My heart's in the right place on page seventeen

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill

Heart's in the right place
I'm going to destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
Because I'm an old bitch you see and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree

Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium

Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance

But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like Belgium

Oh, it's just like Belgium
Isn't that just like Belgium
Oh, it's just like Belgium
Isn't that just like Belgium They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

Nobody wins, nobody wins
La-la-la-la, la-la, la-la
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B
And all that political crap

Because I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff

If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through


When I see your fascist faces Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire

I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born


And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You, you rather have the wealth of kings
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind

And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
The fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
Well mama, just a kick away, just a kick away
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind Staring all alone and your grace and style
Cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes
Always unprepared for your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
They say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you

If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
But I would give my life for a single night beside you Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do

So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road

Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair

And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Because I am the fox, like it or not

I'm always going to be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire

So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights





The designated flights I got home today, took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine, she could not be found
All her things were gone, she just left a note
It don't take no mastermind to figure what she wrote

She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

I don't want her back, I won't even try
This time isn't just au revoir, this time it's goodbye
We could not go on, living like we were
I was just about to write a 'Dear John' note to her

I was going to say, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm going to
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long
Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm going to
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete

Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child


Spiteful I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out


Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby


I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm going to quit this game `cause baby I've had enough

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart

And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today
Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two

It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah

There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place I've been beaming aboard her for a light year
From a strange craft
She's got a subtle touch on the silver key
To a clockwork heart

I am your robot 
I am your robot man
I am your robot 
I am your robot man

You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive
When I was negative
I've been stumbling around like a metal man
On the graveyard shift


I am your robot and I'm programmed to love you
My serial number is 44357

I am your robot Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden? Haven't you heard what's new
There is a rumour
Going around that suddenly I've found you
Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do
You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess
Haven't you heard them say
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
But love is the sweetest way
Oh I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)
Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

Oh won't somebody tell me
Tell me where have all the good times gone
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone

Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah we had a good time)
Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you


They've gone away
Gone they've gone away 
They've gone away

It's hard enough to lose the game
And sad to see it played again
What makes you happy for a while
Is gonna make you smile through the rain



Won't you please tell me where have all the good times gone All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime

And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

(Ooh!)

Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas!
(Cold as christmas in the middle of the year)
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)


Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah) Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me

You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero 

Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack Well he could almost taste the money
But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide
He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Well, she was silent as he paid her
But the thanks she got was next to none
And as her car pulled out of the motel
She felt the presence of someone
And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo (stereo)
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man


And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo (stereo)
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion
Mm-hm-hm
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

(Ooh) Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues


Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide

And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars


Oh Crystal Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, "Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?"
I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did
And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Oh, I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah! You're cruel, you do
You do, you do me wrong
You hurt me, you flirt with
Any old face that comes along

But I won't be your whipping boy
No I won't be your whipping boy
Break me like a little toy
Run me till my feet are sore
But I won't be your whipping boy

You're wild, you're sly
What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three


It's this illegal kind of loving
That keeps my motor running
From the start to the finish line
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying
I'm still trying, yes I'm trying
You're dirty, but you're worth it
But you're way, you're way too young
I could do time if they found out
Look out, San Quentin here I come


I won't be your whipping boy You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's going to stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down

And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint 

I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise He said I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him
He must have been romantic
He must have sensed adventure
And I feel the steel of his strong will
In the frame around his picture

And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him
Forever always young

He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again


One more arrow 
Forever always young Finny Music

Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year

Hit the pent like I'm Derek Fisher
Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her
Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew)
Ha, real player like my pops (pops)
Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot)
We run it, not opps (ha)
Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said "uh yeah nigga, four times"
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like "MA, where the album at?"
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2"
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up,  and I'm back to  where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

Just make sure to always stay true to who you are", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like "God damn, man, who is he?"
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
"Who Run It" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like "Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?"
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you  met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg "What's the wiz-zard?"
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner

Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer

Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these

And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track  Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies

Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean

Behind me but I lied (that's on my mama) Steamboat waiting by the waterside
Sunlight shining on the morning tide
Got my ticket in my hand
Got some celebrating planned
Can't remember when I felt so fine
I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last
If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here
Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise
Tell the captain not to take too long
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong
Fires are burning down below
Come on steamboat don't be slow
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Wind the springs, set the course
Pull some strings before I turn to force
Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard and make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here
Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise
You're my dreamboat, yes you are
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born
You're my dreamboat, yes you are They laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town
There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind
Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks
They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest
On the plains above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action among the spectres of his troops
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military camp It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot
Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and
Buried

And Everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless

Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching
They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're
Touching
Well we could be children from the way we're acting
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
We just breed and we lose our nerve
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world Hey there, Georgie
Got a couple of things to say
One, you're my friend, and two, it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied and I can only try
To talk you out of a fall
Because the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin wall

Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Oh, man, you've got to watch yourself
She's going to get in your head, she's going to crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else

Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorcee
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You better cut her loose
Before she gets her hooks in you
If you gave her the world and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotised with her big brown eyes
And a body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie, boy, you're in for a shock



Well, it isn't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralysed with a pack of lies
About honour and the single girl
And if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows that shadow's me
I won't crawl I caused you trouble
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes

My friends all say don't go to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I want to know who's in my foot steps
I want to know who wears these shoes

My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I want to know who's in my footsteps
I want to know who wears these shoes, darling

Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
When I face the two of you

Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do



Darling, come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
Come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
I got to blue whether it's true
I got to blue whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue

Whether it's true I got to blue
Whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile

It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone She looked so easy because she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer, that's acid rain

And I don't know
Why little frigerator you're so cold
Go little frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Little frigerator you're so cold

She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet Deny the passenger, who want to get on 
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on

To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail


Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train


The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon

She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up

In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

In neon

Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough
Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends
Tell me where living starts

And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire
Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine
Lovers leap off burning buildings

No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read "do not disturb"
Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward
This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line
Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself


Did he shoot her  Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say (ah...)
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn 'em on (turn 'em on), oh, turn 'em on (turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs (sad songs)
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Can feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When everything you do is goin' wrong
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la) It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard
Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town

Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town
Oh oh no

Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games
Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war

No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through

And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove

Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet

But I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths
And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young

If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners
And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
Because you're too young

Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young
We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up

Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance

Starving for affection, waiting to be fed
Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive

Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again

I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite

Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines
I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman



Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say

Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say


Dope and pills, guns kill
Death just buys cheap thrills
Coal mines, closed down
Nobody's working underground today
Teen dreams, on two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound
Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound

You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound

Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound

Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall
Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need

The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep Written by elton john

What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?

Ooh, and sorry seems to be the hardest word You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)


Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah) Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life
And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day
We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name
And idolise twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire

And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire 

No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire  She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her
She's in a most peculiar phase
You can rear end her oh it'll send her
She wants you, she'll have you her own way
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Because she'll bring you down to your knees
You can beat her but don't mistreat her
Oh don't believe that woman please
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
Because she'll burn you
Turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
Because she'll hurt you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman boys
She's a man-eater, oh don't you cheat her
She'll cut you just to watch you bleed
A woman half crazy, oh then again lazy
With an appetite to feed
She's a liar oh you can't buy her
Because she'll bring you down to your knees
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Oh don't believe that woman please

Mean sister, tongue-twister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
Soul sister, two-fister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived
If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece
And I'll go it alone
Call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick
Till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you
There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean
If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave You win again, you gypsy heart
I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay
It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long
Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy when we meet again
I'll play my part
And wrap you up inside my arms
Oh you gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling then I'll just pretend
Right from the start
You never left me on my own oh you gypsy heart
I pray each day that you are gone
This time oh it won't be so long The weather man he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that do you
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience so
You're a sinking ship with no place to go Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the window sill
And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There isn't one little girl that's home

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the world
He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head
There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash it'll drive you crazy
Because the cops invade your dreams Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Well I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed
So shut that door when the baby cries
And keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed
And spoil me

Angeline
Get to work when the whistle screams, Angeline

Maybe someday, someway
Somewhere in the future, there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash
And bite me

Angeline
Let me use you like a sex machine, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer (that hammer) and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean
(Ooooo-ooooooo
Oooo)

Angeline
(Oooo)

Well I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me
And trust me

Angeline
And talk real dirty, and I'll make you scream, Angeline

You've got to swing that (that) hammer (hammer) and punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer (that hammer) and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Here am I, standing by
To see if you still love me
Why conceal, you still feel
The need to push and shove me
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted

Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of

Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well this I vow, here and now
My love will never never never leave you
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
Ours for all eternity


More than just a memory of love Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down

I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight

But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas
The left bank is crying
For colour to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris
You were the best of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price
It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colours you need Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed
And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away
I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me I'll say it again this is not my city
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty
There weren't these thieves
We had some thing in common
Goals to achieve
We had some thing in common
In a town of plenty

Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty

I'll say it again, this is not my city
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist



When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard
I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just a-have to quit 'em if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand a-feedin' me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Go on with you like that
Oh yeah
Takin' me back Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you

And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands

Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time


And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
To the distant sound of drums
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
As the dragons on the mainland
Wait to heat the sun Say goodbye to loneliness
Say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes
And the confusion that surrounds you
Say goodbye to misery
Say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time
And the fools that choose to view

Say goodbye to Wendy
Say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys
From the Palisades to Kona

Say goodbye to Glasnost
Say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress
And the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids
Say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music
From the Capa to the Coda

Say goodbye to gridlock
Goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer
If there's any of it left

Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Me!

Say goodbye to Jackie
Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools
Goodbye to evangelists and
Geeks with power tools
Goodbye to statuettes
Say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on
Who the senator kissed

Say goodbye to hair styles
Goodbye to heaven's gate
Goodbye to Rocky Five
Six, Seven and Eight

Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Me, yeah!


Don't it wanna make you crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Overkill and me Hey, there

I see you tempt the night
I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies
You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis

And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies
There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies


I recommend first prize
For acting so surprised
For acting like you love me
The camera never lies
I'll take my wounded pride
I'll take it on the chin
Your profile fills the frame
How good you look on film

And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies
There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies


Smoke screens and sweet deceiving
Replace the face of trust
The shutter falls each time you meet him
(Ooh)
A negative becomes my plus
(Aah)

And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies
There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

I'm watching all of your secrets
Oh! The camera never lies Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo
Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside

Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic

Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls

And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
Because she hates those Texas girls

Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow



Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there hasn't been no looking back
Since God invented girls

Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls

Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan
Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there haven't been no angels round
Since God invented girls

Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls I don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said
But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin
We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
And love is just another means
By which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt
But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course
It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood

Takin' me back I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard
I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side

Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me We can spend the night right
So honey turn out the lights
And do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow
You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow
Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry
You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow
You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow
You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
Come on and do it nice and slow
You can do it, you can do it I know
You can do it nice and slow
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it nice and slow, slow
I like it when you do it slow, slow
Come on and do it
Do it nice and slow Suzie walks her dog but it don't solve
All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please
Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out
Campus queen dreams shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows
It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song
Mama said to me, John you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf
I want to write a country love song, tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart
There is nothing more, something said before
C'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so-and-so
And I'm the one who knows Oh my love
I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through 

Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill

Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on you Baby, so they give you anythin'
Darlin', all the joy money can bring
Baby, do they bring you happiness
Darlin', you're no different from the rest

Can't you see that it's love you really need
Take my hand, and I'll show what a love could be
Before it's too late

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Baby, fancy friends show you a smile
Darlin', rich relations for a while
Baby, I can only give you love
Darlin', a-this old heart should be enough

All I need is a chance to make you mine
Let me in, oh, I'll change the way you feel inside
Before it's too late

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love Catch a star if you can
Wish for somethin' special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listenin'
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
(Ooh, ooh, baby)

You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there
Lovin' you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us, angels will know us

Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Love
(Ooh, ooh, baby)
(Ooh, ooh, baby)
(Ooh, ooh, baby)

Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love? Loving you was easy
Your love captured my heart
You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart
Said you needed both of us
How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl 'cause I'm gonna fix you
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
Sneaking out on Sunday
You thought I didn't know
Well early morning Monday
Once more you didn't show
Alibis and selfish lies
Oh I've had my fill of them all
You can dry your crying eyes
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
Look out girl your heart might be breaking There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again

When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop

And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason
Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke

Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out

Hope froze in the cold weather
No ice on a greasy river
Liberty and John Doe
Stand and Shiver
War waits when the lines form
The baby sitter in a uniform
Knocking down your door
For your rice and corn There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows

And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.
THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.

THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.
(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)
THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!
THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?
THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.
(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)
CISSY CAFFREY

I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)
THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.
(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)
PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.
PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!
CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)
She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.

(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)
STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.
(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)
THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.
THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)
EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.
STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.
(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)
LYNCH So that?
STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.
LYNCH Ba!
STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.
LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.
(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)
LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.
Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.
At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)
BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)
BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)
BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)
BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)
THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)
THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.
BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.
(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)
THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?
BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?
THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)
BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
BLOOM O!
(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.
BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.
RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.
RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
BLOOM Mamma!
ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?
(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!
BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.
(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)
BLOOM Molly!
MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...
MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
THE SOAP
We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
MARION (Softly.) Poldy!
BLOOM Yes, ma'am?
MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)
BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...
(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.
BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN Mr.
BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .
MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.
BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?
MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.
MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.
MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?
MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!
BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?
MRS BREEN Let's.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
THE BAWD Jewman's melt!
BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.
BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .
MRS BREEN Too.
BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .
MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.
(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)
THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?
THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.
THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!
PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.
PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!
PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.
THE NAVVY (Shouts.)
We are the boys. Of Wexford.
PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
THENAVVY (Shouts.)
The galling chain.
And free our native land.

(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)
BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.
(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)
Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)
THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)
THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)
FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.
(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)
THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.
BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)
BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)
SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.
BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)
SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.
BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.
FIRST WATCH Proof.
(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)
BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.
FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.
SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.
BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.
(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)
THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.
MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.
BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.
SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.
BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.
FIRST WATCH Regiment.
BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.
BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...
(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)
MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)
BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.
BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?
BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.
BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY
Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.

BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.
BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.
BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.
FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)
SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.
FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?
MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.
BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.
MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!
FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?
MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.
BLOOM She counterassaulted.
MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!
(General laughter.)
GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )
(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)
LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.
PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.
(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)
(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)
Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...

(He is howled down.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.
BLOOM A penny in the pound.
(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)
DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.
(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)
BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...
MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.
MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!
(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)
THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.
MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.
MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.
(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.
BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!
BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.
MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)
MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?
BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.
(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)
DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.
(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)
THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)
Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo

(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)
THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.
(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)
THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.
THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?
THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.
THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.
FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.
SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.
THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.
(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)
THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)
(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)
LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?
(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)
RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.
(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)
THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!
BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .
HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.
SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!
(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)
PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.
(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)
BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?
PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!
BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.
SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?
FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.
PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.
A VOICE O rocks.
PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.
(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)
FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.
(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.
PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.
(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!
JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.
(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)
PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.
(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)
TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.
(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)
THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!
(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)
BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.
(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)
ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.
BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?
ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?
BLOOM Not I!
ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?
(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)
ZOE How's the nuts?
BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.
ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.
BLOOM Not likely.
ZOE I feel it.
(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)
BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.
ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?
(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)
ZOE You'll know me the next time.
BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.
(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)
ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.
BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.
ZOE And you know what thought did?
(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)
BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?
ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?
BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.
ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.
BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!
(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)
THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!
BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...
AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!
(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)
THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!
(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)
LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.
COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.
BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...
(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)
BLOOM'S BOYS
The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.

A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.
A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!
(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)
A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?
A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!
A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!
A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.
(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)
THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!
ALL God save Leopold the First!
BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.
WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?
BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.
MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!
(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)
THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.
(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)
BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.
(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)
JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!
BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.
(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)
TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.
BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.
THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!
JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.
A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!
AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.
AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.
BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.
(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)
THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)
(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)
THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.
BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!
(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)
THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!
THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS
Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.

(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)

BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.

BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!

THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!

(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)

BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.

(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)

JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.

PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?

BLOOM Pay them, my friend.

PADDY LEONARD Thank you.

NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?

BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.

J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!

NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?
BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.
JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?
BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?
BEN DOLLARD Pansies?
BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.
BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?
BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.
LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.
BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.
CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.
BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.
ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?
BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.
O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.
DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!
BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.
LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?
(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)
FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.
MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!
MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!
NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.
BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)
I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.

HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.
PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!
BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)
LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!
THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.
BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.
THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.
THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)
(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)
ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!
THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)
BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.
DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.
(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)
DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.
DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.
(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)
BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.
MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.
(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)
A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?
BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.
BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.
BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.
(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A DEADHAND (Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?
A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?
A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?
BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.
THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!
(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)
THE ARTANE ORPHANS
You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!

THE PRISON GATE GIRLS
If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.
(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)
MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!
(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)
MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.
BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!
(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)
REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.
THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!
BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.
(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)
THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!
BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.
(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)
THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.
(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)
ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.
BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.
BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.
ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.
BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?
ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?
BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.
ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.
BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.
ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.
BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.
ZOE Babby!
BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.
THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.
ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.
(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)
THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!
(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)
ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.
BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.
ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.
(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)
KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!
ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)
KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?
LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.
(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)
KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!
ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.
(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)
STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?
THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!
STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
THE CAP Bah!
STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .
THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.
STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)
STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!
LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?
ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.
(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)
FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.
KITTY No!
ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!
FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.
(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)
THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.
(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)
STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.
(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)
ALL What?
THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)
FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!
(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)
THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...
(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)
THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?
(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)
ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...
THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.
(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)
THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!
ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.
KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.
STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.
(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)
THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.
LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.
(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)
BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.
(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)
MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.
(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)
THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!
(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)
ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?
LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.
ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?
LYNCH I'm not looking.
ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?
(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)
VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.
BLOOM Granpapachi. But...
VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
BLOOM She is rather lean.
VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.
VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.
VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...
BLOOM With?...
VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.
BLOOM The stye I dislike.
VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.
(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .
VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.
BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?
VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!
(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)
BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.
VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!
BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...
VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.
BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...
BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.
VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.
I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!

(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.
(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)
HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.
(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)
STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.
(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)
ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.
FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.
STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?
FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.
(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)
PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.
PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?
(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?
FLORRY And the song?
STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.
STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.
PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.
ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.
VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!
LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.
ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.
BLOOM Poor man!
ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.
BLOOM How?
VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.
KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.
PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?
PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.
(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)
LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.
FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.
ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.
LYNCH Three wise virgins.
VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!
(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)
BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.
(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)
THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!
A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.
BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.
HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.
VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!
(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)
THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.
HENRY All is lost now.
(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)
VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!
(Exeunt severally.)
STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.
LYNCH All one and the same God to her.
STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.
FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.
LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.
STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.
(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)
THE CARDINAL
Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.

(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.
(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.
(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.
(The trick doorhandle turns.)
THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.
ZOE The devil is in that door.
(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)
ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.
BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?
ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.
(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)
KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.
BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.
(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)
BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.
ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.
(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)
BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.
(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)
BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.
(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)
THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.
BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .
THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.
BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.
THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?
BLOOM Yes. No.
THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)
BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.
THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!
RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.
THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.
BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.
BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.
THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.
BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!
(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)
BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.
THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?
THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.
BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!
(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)
BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.
BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!
BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!
BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!
BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!
BELLO Dungdevourer!
BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.
BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!
BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!
(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)
BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.
BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.
BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.
(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.
ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.
BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.
FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.
KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.
BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.
BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.
(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)
BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!
BELLO (Twisting.) Another!
BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!
BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)
BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...
BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.
FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.
KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.
(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)
MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)
BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?
BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.
ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?
BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.
BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.
BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.
BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?
BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...
BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?
BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.
BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?
BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.
BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.
BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.
(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )
BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...
BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !
BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...
BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.
BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)
BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
BLOOM Thank you, mistress.
BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!
A BIDDER A florin!
(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)
A VOICE One and eightpence too much.
THE LACQUEY Barang!
CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.
VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.
BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.
BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?
BLOOM Eccles Street.
BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!
BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.
BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.
BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...
BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.
(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)
SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!
BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.
BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.
(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)
MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!
BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.
BLOOM They... I
BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.
BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...
A VOICE Swear!
(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)
BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.
BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?
(He bites his thumb.)
BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)
BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)
THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.
VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.
(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)
THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.
THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!
BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.
THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.
THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?
THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.
BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.
THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.
BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.
BLOOM You understood them?
THE YEWS Ssh.
THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.
THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!
BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)
THE WATERFALL
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.

THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.
JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!
THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)
THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!
(They cheer.)
BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!
THE ECHO Fool!
THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?
THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?
THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
THE WATERFALL
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.

THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!
BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)
STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.
BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.
(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)
THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!
BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)
THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?
(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)
COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...
BLOOM Done. Prff.
THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?
BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.
THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.
BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?
(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)
THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.
THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.
(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)
THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!
THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.
THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.
THE WATERFALL
Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.

THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!
THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.
(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)
THE BUTTON Bip!
(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)
THE SLUTS
O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.
THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!
THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!
BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?
THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !
BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)
BELLA You'll know me the next time.
BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.
BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!
BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.
BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?
ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.
(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)
BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.
ZOE
Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.

BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.
ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.
BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?
(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)
STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.
LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.
BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.
STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.
(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)
FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)
BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.
STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.
ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.
LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!
KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)
FLORRY And me?
LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)
STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.
BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.
BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.
ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)
BLOOM This is yours.
STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.
BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.
STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.
BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?
STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.
BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.
STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.
BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.
BLOOM No, but...
STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)
LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.
STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.
ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.
FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.
STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)
BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?
ZOE Is he hungry?
STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)
Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.

ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.
LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?
ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)
LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.
(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)
FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.
(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)
DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.
ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.
STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
ZOE What day were you born?
STEPHEN Thursday. Today.
ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.
FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.
ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?
BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.
BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.
ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.
BLOOM Wrong.
ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?
(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)
BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)
BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.
ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)
FLORRY What?
(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)
THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?
(Bronze by gold they whisper.)
ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.
(They whisper again.)
(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)
LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?
BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.
LENEHAN A good night's work.
BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.
LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.
BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?
BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...
BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?
BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.
BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!
BELLA What? What is it?
(Zoe whispers to her.)
MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.
BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.
BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...
KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)
MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.
KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.
BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!
MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!
BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!
BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!
LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.
(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)
SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!
BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?
ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.
BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...
(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)
FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!
SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!
SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.
(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)
MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.
MARTIN CUNNINGHAM
(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!
STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.
BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.
LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.
ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.
(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)
LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.
STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!
LYNCH Vive le vampire!
THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!
STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.
BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...
STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)
BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...
THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!
STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.
ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.
LYNCH Across the world for a wife.
FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.
STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?
BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.
STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!
BLOOM I say, look...
STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!
(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)
SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!
(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)
THE CROWD
Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!

(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)
THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!
GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!
(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)
THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!
(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)
STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!
ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!
PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY
Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...

ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?
BLOOM Who'll.
LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.
STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)
ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.
(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)
ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?
(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)
MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!
(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)
THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.
(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)
MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!
(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)
HOURS You may touch my.
CAVALIERS May I touch your?
HOURS O, but lightly!
CAVALIERS O, so lightly!
THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.
(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)
MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!
(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)
THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!
ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!
MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!
(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)
ZOE I'm giddy.
(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)
MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!
(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)
MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!
THE PIANOLA
Best, best of all,
Baraabum!

KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!
(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)
THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.
ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!
(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)
STEPHEN Pas seul!
(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)
THE PIANOLA
Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.

(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)
TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!
SIMON Think of your mother's people!
STEPHEN Dance of death.
(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)
(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)
STEPHEN Ho!
(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)
THE CHOIR
Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...

(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)

BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.

THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.

STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?

BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.

THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.

STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.

THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.

STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.

THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.

STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!

THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.

ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!

FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.

BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.

THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!

STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!

THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)

STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)

BLOOM (At the window.) What?

STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!

FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)

THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!

STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!

THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.

STEPHEN Nothung!

(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)

THE GASJET Pwfungg!

BLOOM Stop!

LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!

BELLA Police!

(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!

(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)

THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.

ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.

BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.

BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?

A WHORE He tore his coat.

BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.

BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...

BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.

BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...

BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!

BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!

FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?

BELLA Do you want me to call the police?

BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.

BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!

BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.

BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?

ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.

BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!

(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)

STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.

PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?

STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.

CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.

STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.

VOICES She's faithfultheman.

CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.

PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.

PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?

LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.

PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.

STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.

CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.

STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...

PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?

STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.

(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?

DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.

(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)

BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.

STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.

(He staggers a pace back.)

BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.

STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.

BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.

CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.

BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.

CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.

PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?

(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.

(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)

PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.

STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)

My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.

STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...
PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.
BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.
STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.
PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.
STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.
(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)
KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.
(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)
PATRICE Socialiste!
DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!
BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.
STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.
BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.
THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.
THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!
A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.
THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)
May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.

THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)
I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.

RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.
(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)
THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.
(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)
RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!
EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)
On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!

PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?
STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.
PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?
STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...
(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)
STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!
OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?
STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.
CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!
A ROUGH Our men retreated.
PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.
BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.
THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!
(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)
PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.
STEPHEN Did I? When?
BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.
THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!
(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)
MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.
PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.
PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.
(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)
CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!
CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.
BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.
CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!
STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.
PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.
BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.
CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!
STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)
White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.

VOICES Police!
DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!
(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)
FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.
THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.
FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.
THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.
THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!
(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)
ADONAI Dooooooooooog!
THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!
(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)
ADONAI Goooooooooood!
(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)
PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!
OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!
BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?
LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)
STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.
BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.
STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.
CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.
BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.
PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.
(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)
MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!
THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.
THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!
(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)
What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!
THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.
(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)
THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.
BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!
PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!
(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)
FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?
PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?
CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?
A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.
BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...
SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?
PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.
BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.
SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.
PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.
FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?
BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.
FIRST WATCH Name and address.
(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)
BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.
SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.
CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?
FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.
(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)
CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?
FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.
CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?
SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.
CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.
SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.
CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.
BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.
FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.
SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.
FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.
BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.
SECOND WATCH It's our duty.
CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.
THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)
BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.
CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.
BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...
CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!
BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...
(The horse neighs.)
THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)
CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.
BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!
THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.
BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...
(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)
CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.
BLOOM Night.
(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)
BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!
STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...
(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)
BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!
(Murmurs.)
... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...

(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)
BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...
(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)
BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!
RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) Have you seen the North
That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore
On my face
A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see
A better place
In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south

The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river

And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore
There's a North in us all
But my North can't hold me anymore She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers

Because you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind


And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around

And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down

Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends abord the evening
Canary sings to an empty room I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove
Because it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever going to to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel

Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street

All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay
But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning

Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women

I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven
How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son Looking back in anger
On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace
Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast
And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right
I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves
Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms
There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart
And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep
But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep
Fat boys and ugly girls Whenever I hear good-byes
Reminds me baby of you
I break down and cry
Next time I'll be true, yeah
*Feels as if we lost romance*
Reminds me baby of you
*I took a crazy chance*
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance-floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
*When I'm dancing round*
Remind me baby of you
I really let you down
Next time I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance-floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
Hurting deep inside, she cries on every tune
I break down and cry, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune
Footsteps on the dance-floor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true yeah
Whispers in the powder room, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune
And the music dont feel like it did (no, no) when i felt it with you (no, no)
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels (never feels) like i felt it with you (no, no)
And the music don't feel like it did (no, no) when i felt it with you
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels like i felt it with you (woahhh, woahh, woahhh, woooooahhhh)
Feels as if we lost romance
I took a crazy chance
Lovers holding hand
Remind me baby of you
Next time, I'll be true (fade) Holding all the pictures that my life's drawn
I never find I'm missing love
Remembering all parades that had been rained on
But never cloudy leaving love

Ask me what it is that makes it special
Why it's so real to me?

It's knowing who keeps their place in my heart
It's knowing how is it I can feel you
It's knowing never will I change my mind
When I think about love, I think about you

When I think about love, I think about you

Too many times I've turned my emotions on and off
Without realizing what it does
Know what's moved me and kept me going this far
But I never questioned what it was I have sold myself through and through
I have walked in the darkness too
Felt a red sun, the living proof
Washed my hands in the honest truth
I have carried this weight time after time
I have bettered the dumb and the blind
I've seen dignity fail and colors run
Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun

And we walk, yes we walk
And we walk with the power every day
Never letting the light slip away

Reaching out, reaching in
Touching truth and touching skin
Never letting the light slip away
And we walk with the power every day

If my faith is a fire then burn baby burn
We've held fire long enough to learn
Heat beneath hope is a healing light
Kept alive by the flames of night
Walk tall in the power day after day
Never, never, never lose sight of the way
See the dawn come and the dusk hang
See the power rise from an open hand



Walk with the power
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah we walk, yeah we walk
Yes we walk with the power every day
Never letting the light slip away

Reaching out, reaching in
Touching truth and touching skin
Never letting the light slip away
And we walk with the power every day Lady luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
Until your leaving dampened the situation

Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl you better throw me a life preserver
Because I'm about to drown in my own tears Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feelin' far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on, it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true

Give me your true love, oh yeah
True love, (True love) true love
Got to give me your true love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
True love, (True love) true love (True love)

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
Love, forever true love If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you

If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you
Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus sideshows
That laughed in the rain
You stayed with the full moon
You searched for the stars
Thank God in His heaven
Here we both are

If you were me and I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do?
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
If you were me and I was you

If you were me and I was you Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same
I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me

I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need

A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs

I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted for all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself



Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs I want to be good, I want to be strong
But I treated him bad, I've done him wrong
I've taken his money, I'm given him hell
And he takes it all 'cause he knows me well
We can say what we mean and mean what we say
We don't like to mess around
But we're there to hold each other up
When we're falling down

Just like an old friend
Putting me on my feet again
Giving me back my pride then
Letting me go

Just like an old friend
Putting me in my place again
Giving me back my hope then
Letting me know that he's an old friend

I don't suffer no fools, I testify
But he must be one for being by my side
I've broken his heart, I've shaken his tree
But still he doesn't want anything from a fool like me
We won't talk for a year or two
Maybe when we do, we won't say much
Even so we know that out of mind
Is never out of touch


We're having a man-to-man
Don't want to get sentimental
But both of us understand
We'll never have to say goodbye, just see you later


Just like an old friend
Putting me in my place again
Giving me back my hope then
Letting me know On and On

She broke my heart, he hurt me too
That's something that only unworthy souls do
They said goodbye, we say hello
An introduction for a perfect love to grow

Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on

She said she'd stay, he said that too
So sad when you find out your love has found a new
She made me cry, he made me weep
But life has love in store for us that's ooh so sweet

On and On (love keeps going on)
On and On (they've got the whole of life)
On and On (love keeps going on)
On and

It's time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring
That starts from summer love to last through autumn, winter, spring
Our hearts will sing forever, love Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart Isn't nothing like the real thing, baby
Isn't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hanging on my wall
But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear


I play my games of fantasy
I pretend I don't see reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of you being there
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together

I'm so
So glad we got the real thing, baby
Isn't nothing like the real thing Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet
I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet
Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet
Your every wish is my command
All you got to do is wiggle your little hand

I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you


Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet
Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string


Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now
I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you

Born to lose
Oh it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through
I'm born to lose
And now I'm losing you

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
(Now I'm losing you) I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me Damn, it's really bright up here (I'm not afraid to piss and moan)
I guess I shoulda brought some sunglasses, if I knew we were shooting a video outside (about my feelings and how I've grown)
Now some of you out there might be up on your roof talking to yourself too (now I've got no sense of humor about myself, but I take shots at everyone else)
But you ain't famous rappers, so no-one cares (I'm like a kid and god forbid)
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going downstairs (people call be out on stupid things that I did)

You can try to throw away my lyric sheets before I can read 'em
Ha! too bad I  got em memorized I don't even need 'em
Yeah I still got homophobic rhymes but you can't get upset
Cus that fag Elton John and I once did a duet
To my fans, I apologize for ruining your life
I'll get back to writing songs about murdering my wife
He spits his lines in perfect time without any rehearsin'
Sometimes he rhymes about himself in the third person
His rapping is hilarious or completely serious
And if you make fun of him then he will get frikkin' furious
Cus he can dish it out but he just can't take it
Like a baker who hates cake, but always bakes it
Who's this dude looking at me? He looks just like me
He's clocking me mocking me, I think he wants to fight me
Ow, I tried to hit the man but he broke my hand and then he ran
Musta been a crazed fan
Oh, damn, there he is again

I'm not afraid to throw a chair its from IKEA so I don't care
I'm bumping into people on the street
I'm wearing Shape Ups on my feet
I'm just like you, I've been there too
I'm rich and famous so I take that back it's not true

It was my decision to do drugs, I did it for fun but now I'm done
Now I'll get back to making puns about Kim Kardashian
And her two tons buns of fun, so gargantuan that they block out the Sun
I'm the world's greatest rapper, a fact that's undisputed
But for some reason I act like I am persecuted
If you think I'm a turkey well then you can just stuff it
I'm the only MC to have a beef with a puppet
I could rap about Afghanistan, Iraq or BP
But I'd rather make fun of some minor celebrities
Here's a list of people that I'd like to impeach:
Patricia Headon, Will Weaton, Ruben Studdard, and Screech
But I won't diss Kanye or Lil Wayne, that ain't fun
They're both really nice, they ain't hurt no one
But screw Michael J. Fox, cus he shakes when he walks
Aren't you glad that I'm back to get this message across

I'm not afraid to get really pissed
At all my critics, that hardly exist
I'm such whiny baby, I'll keep complaining
I'm rich as hell, my records sell
I'm such an ass, but I get a pass
People love me cus I can rhyme words really fast I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothin' to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me

Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

But love
I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease

Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

Without love
I believe in love


Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anythin' that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

Without love, I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you and I wouldn't believe in me

Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say 'homo'
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they've all got it wrong

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England (sing it!)
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

I
Was
Made
In
England!
I
Was
Made
In
England!
I
Was
Made
In
England!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, oh
Oh
I was made in England
Whoa, rock on, boy, yeah
Hey This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe

This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me

This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again
Because this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house


This is my house You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance
I held my breath
Love always ends up
Hanging by a thread

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

You said, "Don't cry to me"
He said, "I'm a dead man if you leave"
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out
The warm and tender part

Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

I don't care
I came back for you
I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
But I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

I'm cold
Cold
So cold
Cold
Ohh I'm cold
Honey, I'm cold
So cold
I'm so cold
Cold
Ohh I'm cold
I'm so cold
Cold
Ohh I'm so cold
Cold
I'm cold
Cold What's your name?
My name is pain
Where do you live?
I live anyplace
Where were you born?
In the state of fear
How old are you?
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years
What's your plan?
My plan is pain
When will you leave?
I'll never go away
How will you breathe?
You'll give me life
How will you see?
Sitting in the temple right between your eyes

My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

Pain is love
Pain is pure
Pain is sickness
Pain is the cure
Pain is death
Pain is religion
Pain is life
Pain is television
Pain walks
Pain crawls
Pain is peace
Pain is war
Where were you born?
In the state of fear
How old are you?
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain
I am pain
I am pain
I am pain
I am pain Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes
Belfast

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place
Belfast

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down
Belfast

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver face
Belfast Grey London morning
Wet London streets
Rain on the window
Wind in the trees
It's my time to write
It's your time to call
There's something about distance
That gets to us all

Dark clouds above me
Little people below
All walk with a purpose
With someplace to go
It's my place to paint
My own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas
It's just the weather and me

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

Cracks in the sidewalks
Dogs on the run
An old poster reading
"Give us your sons"
Window frames capture
Moments in time
But latitude captures
The heart and the mind

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude
Latitude
Latitude
Latitude We've been crippled in love
Short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls
A slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

We've been living with sorrow
Been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

But tied to the same track
The two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times
Can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

He's the hoax
Behind the thrill
The poison arrow
The bitter pill
Hard to swallow
Hard to kill
Hard to understand
He's the light
Behind the hill
The broken promise
The iron will
Hard to kill
Hard to understand

Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man
Have a little faith in man Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth

Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name

Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect

I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose

And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness

I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me

Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

On the flat, dry desert, I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now, I shall be free

Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
You read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means

And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

And so they say, "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us Oh, oh

I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a gray dawn risin' on a green hill
And there's so much behind us
I don't know where we go
I sure feel there's something out there
There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear

If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked, with your harmony

If the river can bend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If the river can bend
(Ooh)
If the river can bend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ha, if the river can bend

Come and embrace the struggle
But win or lose we live here
Build a new beginning on an old rock
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air





Yeah, yeah
If the river can bend
Yeah, yeah Pull my coat around me
Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free?

I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for

All I need is darkness
The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
Alone and cold and burning
Each one keeps it's distance
If only we were stars, you and I There was a time I was everything and nothin' all in one
When you found me, I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun

Well, I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
(The way you look) Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight On and on
The story of our lives goes on and on
The path of time
The sunsets up ahead roll along
In your eyes
The option of a warm embrace implies
You're my friend
Happy endings keep our love alive

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

Want to be your main man in the big picture
What a deal
To get a part like this

Day to day
The shifting wind just blows us on our way
Here and there
Our pockets full of things to say
Oh my love
I proudly represent you in this world
Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

Hope I got a future in the big picture
At the last embrace
From the first kiss

And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on? It's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning

Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go
And hey now let's recover your soul

Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter


Hey now let's recover
Hey now let's recover your soul
And hey now let's recover your soul Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone

And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

Must have kissed you until I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the mornin' light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding

And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder?
Will she still be the star and see me through?
Because I can't steer my heart clear of you

No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history, from the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted, let me burn or bring me water


No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you
You control the weather, and I can't steer my heart clear of you It's written clear, across the room
In silent words the blind could understand
I came here to relax and find
A sleep that soaks me up
Like surf and sand
And you appear as I descend
A soft outline all poised and a feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream
And close my eyes

And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty
Comes undone

And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

So don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked dream We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes

We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes


We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes


Emperor's new clothes  Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma

Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me

It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust
Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain




Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Aren't you proud of me Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
May, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind
Could it be I'm not for real?
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved

Come on Robert Johnson
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland

Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Going to miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen


They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen


Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
I can't wear them anymore  You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me
You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me
You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Isn't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight

In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall



We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
Oh yeah It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I'm weary and I'm staying up late
And the rain hits my roof so hard
You know I'm no longer thirty
These days I'm happy to play
One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

Humidity hangs like a curtain
Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight
These days I'm happy to see
A sunset instead of a line


There's a long list of names
That i don't recall
Even though my memory's good
The rain washed away
The lemons and weeds
When the weight of the world weighed more than it should
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back There's a porch swing in tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-your-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old natchez trace
Through alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden autumn
On the tennessee line
Rolling down to mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth

And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in tupelo
I got nothing to do except hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in tupelo

His mama must have loved him
That truck driving boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock and roll voice
Well i was just thinking about him
Because I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to god through poverty's tears


Here on this porch swing in tupelo Well, they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find
An answer in the sky
Well, they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky


This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're going to jacksonville
Because our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years

You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

I am not going to die, I am not going to cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave
I am not going to going to shake, I am not going to break
I am not going to fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave

It's like a prime time movie
You play the part so well
You do believe you're Heaven sent
And living here is hell
I hear it's hot in Florida
And it's raining here tonight
But the sun going to shine tomorrow
And I'm going to do alright





So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck

But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug

I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and i might grow a beard
There were times i was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price


And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah


In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug She threw back that shiny hair
Like the mane on a delta queen
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
Because she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat

She just does that double act
She got babs and joan down pat
She got hips like mick, she's a rolling stone
Never seen a woman shake like that
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood


She's so fine that the water line
Don't separate hot and cold
She got stitched up bitchy by an old m.D
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told


And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift
Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse

We're just freaks in love, saints above shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union of fools and freaks alike
And fearless are the idiots among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love

There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind
Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood


We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
I always hoped that i'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

]
I always try to make things clear
Then I watched as progress starts
I only hope I'm standing here
When heaven finally comes to call We are still all right
We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour
No one ever wins
But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz

And I stop and I breathe
Because you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Because I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have

Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around
And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt?
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in between

And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Because too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried

The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Some things die so other things might live It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here
I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moon's so spooky
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here

And the wait isn't worth what i'm getting
Sometimes i feel i'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And i'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

Don't talk about angels
Or how i'll be saved
I'm no coward
But i'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here


Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here I can't keep this from you
I've held it in so long
It's time to tell the truth
Keeping it from you is wrong
I can't keep this from you
It's so simple I'm afraid
When I tell you how I feel
You'll just laugh and call me crazy

And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

I can't keep this from you
It's hard to breathe in here
I just seem to act the fool
Every time I feel you near
I can't keep this from you
No matter what you say
Anything is better now
Than going through my life this way


And I love every move you make
Can't you hear every heart you break?
And don't you know when I hear your name?
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames


I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
Oh no i just can't keep this from you What's this?

It's a letter

I can see it's a letter

You can open it if you want

Thank God for that, the suspense was killing me

It's from me mum

Your mum?

She wrote it for us when I was eighteen, but since I couldn't wait

I see

You can read it if you want
Read it out

Dear Billy
I must seem a distant memory

Which is...

Which is probably a good thing
And it will have been a long-

Long time

And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh
Missed your stomping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy
Know that I was always there
I was with you through everything
And please, Billy...

But please, Billy
Know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything
And you must promise me this, Billy

In everything you do
Always be yourself, Billy
And you always will be true
And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stomping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy
Know that I was always there
I was with you through everything
And please, Billy
Know that I will always be
Proud to have known you

Love you forever

Love you forever

Mam Can you hear it in the distance?
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling Heseltine
You're a tosser, you're a wanker
And you're just a Tory Swine I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time, something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music is impossible
Impossible to hear

But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh, I'm free We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
And I guess we’ll have to stay
In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We’re finally on our way
And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were “Where it’s at”
Or so the papers say
And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we’d never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson’s promised land
Where Disney’s God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay
And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he’s just about the coolest guy I’ve ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it’s going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline
Oh, We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay”
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay” It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark

And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

These four walls have seen
The cockettes and the casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark


And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight

But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York city I'd really like to stay
New York city I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way

Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where joey gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right


And I can feel the magic
And read a million lips
And no matter what might happen
They'll never sink this ship Nostradamus said, "I predict
That the world will end at half past six"
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change
Some holes along the road get filled


Pressure's going to cook us if we don't unlock it
Gun's going off if we don't uncock it
We've got to climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread

And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer because I've cancelled out the time


So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall


And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl isn't that enough
To rage against the day

And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the sun king that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons i never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away


And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh I've seen the bridge and the bridge is long
And they built it high and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind

And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away

Standing on the bridge looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide


And the bridge it shines
Oh cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess i must have lost it on the wind

Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst


In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on oxford street
Now we're sitting in the south of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you

Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee wWlliams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside I've been out here on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showin' my friends around
I've seen it growin' from next to nothin'
Into a giant, eatin' up your town
Called up the tea leaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah
She saw a mountain and wild deer runnin'
A crazy kid becoming a better man

But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waitin' to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasin' the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine, silk suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

We've been missin', at times, in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh, we've conjured up what we created
Way back then, when I was standin' up in six-inch heels
Now you're ridin' off into the sunset
And I'm still spinnin' like a Catherine wheel

But we stuck around for the battle
Waitin' for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Diggin' into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

No, you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight

How could I know that you had used me
Fill out some plan of your own
I could have known you'd abused me
Leave me here hurt and alone

If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know that you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I only sung what I wanted to sing
You were a dream in my mind
I never know how you never could be
It didn't take long for me to find
I guess that it's mine for foresee
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you would be
A player just acting for me




If it wasn't for bad you'd be good You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

Yea I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass


Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way
No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathams down
And a sign on the wall saying, "Hope Allowed"
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho Luther left at first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky wave good-bye
They're gonna have to share the wait together
Idle hands will see a good fire slowly die

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly

The old black rooster sang in death down that dirt road
His steps in bold, his man of fancy free
I pray we see him alive and well in the forehead
In that Godforsaken place in Tennessee

Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, men stand united
When flags and bullets start to fly

After all this, if we should prevail
Heaven help the South
When Sherman comes their way I'm looking at a funeral wagon rolling down
A two-lane highway winding past a desert town
A big blue canvas painted by the Master's hand
The shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand
In that mirror maybe that's what's left of me
Wheezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel
Air them out's the best release and get some rest
Carrie don't wait up for me the brakeman's going West

In this room all alone
I dream of you
In this drawer I found someone
I never knew

Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian
I've seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads
A black face carney showman scare a song to death
In my short life I've seen as much as most men need
Now I'm just looking for some cleaner air to breathe

Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian

Far away, far away
So many years, so many days
All along this broken land
I've seen a lover's empty arms
And hunger's empty hand There's no time for waiting
No future to see
Inside the next moment
Nothing might be
The answer is not certain
No time to decide
Is this the last curtain?
There's no place to hide

There's no tomorrow 
There's only today

We all know the story
We've heard it before
We end up no question
Outside of death's door
There's no easy answer
To the question at hand
So easy to ask
And not understand


There's only today If you're looking for the glory
You think that you might find
In a bullet-riddled stolen car
On a back road in the pines
If it's round just like a medal
On a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer

Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit

Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill I hear you singing, "I Shall Be Released"
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
But that's all right, that's ok
Grab the bottle and slide my way
You dreamed of a devil down below
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth

Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green


One big sun coming up
Old moon going down
Thunder breaking in the east
I'm going to love you until it comes around


You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true
You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way

Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Going to have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm going to do They say we bruise too easily
I don't know if it's that way for me
I've seen them come, I've seen them go
I've seen everyone I know
Fall in and out of love
It's just the way it goes
Word is out, silence seems so loud
There's no light above or below me now
I've seen it grow, I've seen it live
I've seen everything I give
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with

And nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh when love is dying

There's a pain you never can explain
Cuts so deep time and time again
I felt it then, I feel it now
But nobody told me how
To fight a world of hurt
Somebody help me now


But love never gets to show you
And I never got to know you
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying
No and love never makes it easy
And I never got that feeling
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying Are you standing outside?
Looking up at the sky
Cursing a wondering star
Well If I were you
I'd throw rocks at the moon
I'd say damn you wherever you are
I don't know where to start
This cage around my heart
Locked up what I'd meant to say
Or I felt all along the way
Just wondering how come
I couldn't take your breath away

Because I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
When I should've sent roses
When you crossed my mind
No other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should've sent roses

Looking back on my life
Oh, if fate should decide
I could do it all over again
I'd build no more walls
I'd stay true and recall
The fragrance of you on the wind
You'll get better than me
Someone who can see
Right from the start
Given all that you need
I'll slip away
Knowing I'm half the man I could be


Yeah should've sent roses I'm out here in the darkness
I hear the howling wind
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Will I ever see love again
Looking for an answer
Not an easy thing to find
Out here in the wilderness
With questions on my mind
Now the sun is rising higher in the sky
The morning light is crawling
From the darkness of the night
The raindrops keep on falling
There is no light of day
The sadness deep inside me
Doesn't seem to go away

And there's no way out. no road home
I'm lost in doubt and I'm all alone
The time has come
When love is done
Hearts have finally turned to stone

No more bright tomorrow, only sad today
My heart is filled with sorrow
The pain won't go away
Try to keep from crying
All night long and through the day
Lost and all alone
Hearts have finally turned to stone Don't abandon life
Don't step away
Don't give up that tune
That you never could play
If you're folding your tent
And the gas pipes groan
If every bone rattles
Through nights all alone
Well you're tougher than leather
No old burlap sack
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Growing up through the cracks

Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody

Don't think you've gone out
Don't flicker and fade
If you're going to get lemons
Then do what they say
The wind makes you weary
It knocks you around
Logs on the fire
Beats sun shining down
But you're harder than nails
No skinny old tack
You're still sharp as a razor
And I like you like that


I could bet on a horse
But I'm betting on you
You still got what it takes
You got nothing, nothing to prove Well I could have been sick
I could have died
I could have given up
And not tried
To make it to tomorrow
Like a broken hearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken
It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor
Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses

And they knew all the places
I needed to go
All of the people
I needed to know
They knew who I needed
And who needed me
And who would come help me
And who would just let me be

I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say
When you're in the hands of angels
Life is oh so sweet
And you feel the love
Down deep inside
Even out there on the street

In the hands of angels I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion

Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

Oceans away
Where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away
Oceans away

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed
You never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone walls
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner

And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said "I'm going to keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck"
The boy just whispered "OK"
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a plough share rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
"Gone to California"
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that westbound stage

Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee "Say that boy's a wonderment"
"No! The kid's a freak"
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hopping like a big old frog
And hissing like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
"Boy wouldn't know from money"
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Pay me anything you like
I'll pay it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps them guessing every night
Is he really going to make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slaving
"I wouldn't want him in my yard" I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand
My quicksand

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile
You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Voyeur  I’m countin' on a memory to get me outta here
I’m waitin' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I’ve spent bein' someone else’s friend
Just one more time, for old time’s sake, I’d like to go back home again

The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline
And all around me, I’ve seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I’d say amen if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

Could've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain
Never tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again Spare the rod don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last

Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow them all to Kingdom Come

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

Search out days that never end
If it's only for the chance
To feel just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls


And the dancers danced on through I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See them shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones


The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eye
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles


Yeah, yeah, yeah  Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board

You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board
And the view from the diving board Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car
And it feel like the clocks have stopped
Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'll say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Heart's on fire just one last time
A wishbone snapping in every hand

Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

We found the place to feel it
We knew where we were at
Started the path, felt out our future
Don't everybody need a night like that

Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino

I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside

I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

I'd claim a country
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon

I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know

Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze


Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful, again I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could

I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I am the elder Utah Smith
I take all as they are
I was the first man of the cloth
To blacken a guitar
Love was my redeemer
I felt it from the start
The Holy Ghost was channeled
Through the sound of my guitar

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

Been a long time in the ground
Unmarked is my grave
But I reside elsewhere these days
Thanks to souls I've saved
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Three quarts for the Lord
Till one day he called me home
To claim his great reward

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not actin' up

I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back

Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Lookin' up
Lookin' up
Lookin' up
Lookin' up Hand it over
Reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want
What you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out
Cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

I roamed around
Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so
Never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

Hold out, distilling down
What's it going to be
Never tell
In a million years
No, you can't get enough of me

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure It feels like I'm flying
When I see your face
I'm charged with a power
Of amazing grace
I flip the switch signal
On the permanent dream
Like the palm of my hand
On a tambourine
Dumb rocks filling up
My poor head
Did you just say
What I thought you said
First cat back here gets the cream
And bounce a little river
Of my tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

A curveball coming
That I didn't see
A flash flood washing
Out a dried up creek
A went in muddy
But I came out clean
Like a Baptist banging
On a tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

You're a spinning-round gypsy in the moonlight
Cymbals flashing in the firelight
I'm freefalling into a dream
My hidden heart banging
Like the tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town

You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound

You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there

You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

All my sweet sins  stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

Was your  to watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high

Well I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
(Because I'm)
I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
Where you are tonight Had some good times
Jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America
England and America
England and America
