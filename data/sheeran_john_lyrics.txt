are changed singing' "we found love" in a local rave no, i do not really know what i am supposed to say but i can just figure it out, then hope and pray i told her my name, then said "it is nice to

would wait but then i jumped right in a week later, returned i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn but i gave her my time for two or three nights then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again she told me, "i was never looking for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around ten baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin we will be in between the sheets till the late am" baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she is singing  do not fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i do not wanna know that babe do not fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i do not wanna know that babe  and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza before a text message was the only way to reach her now she is staying at my place and loves the way i treat her singing out area, all over the track like a feature and never wants to sleep, i guess that i do not want to either but me and her, we make money the same way four cities, two planes, the same day and those shows have never been what it is about but maybe we will go together and just figure it out i would rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch but we should get on a plane or we will be missing it now wish i would have written it down, the way that things played out when she was kissing him, how i was confused about now she should figure it out, while i am sat here singing  do not fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i do not wanna know that babe do not fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i do not wanna know that babe  knock, knock, knock on my hotel door i do not even know if she knows what for she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya trust and respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next you bastard but you did not need to take him to bed, that is all and i never saw him as a threat you bastard until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course it is not like we were both on tour we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor and i was not looking for a promise or commitment but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different this is not the way you realised what you wanted it is a bit too much, too late if i am honest and all this time, god knows i am singing  do not fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i do not wanna know that babe do not fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i do not wanna know that babe do not fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i do not wanna know that babe do not fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i do not wanna know that babe i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play a guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder, in any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to steve wonder? under the covers where we used to lay and re: stacks is what the speakers played i would be on tour almost every day when i was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe we used each other is air just for the people to see and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep we go anywhere, our minds would take us and i will say you are beautiful without your make-up and you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us and time is the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i am away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again  oh nina you should go, nina cause i ai not never coming home, nina oh, wo not you leave me now? and i have been living on the road, nina but then again you should know, nina cause that’s you and me both, nina oh, wo not you leave me now, now?  and every weekend in the winter you would be wearing my rookie with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we would eat on our own cause every day when i was away we would only speak on the phone watching blue planet, creating new habits acting as if we were two rabbits and then you would vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear, you call me selfish i understand but i can’t help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you will be in between forever so i guess we will have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i am not saying we should be taking a break just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane but in a day we will have to say it again  oh nina you should go, nina cause i ai not never coming home, nina oh, wo not you leave me now? and i have been living on the road, nina but then again you should know, nina cause that’s you and me both, nina oh, wo not you leave me now, now?  love will come and love will go but you ca not make it on your own sing that song, go oh wo not you leave me now? people grow and fall apart but you ca not mend your broken heart take it back, go oh wo not you leave me now?  oh nina you should go, nina love will come and love will go cause i ai not never coming home, nina but you can make it on your own oh, wo not you leave me now? sing that song, go oh wo not you leave me now and i have been living on the road, nina people grow and fall apart but then again you should know, nina but you can mend your broken heart cause that’s you and me both, nina take it back, go oh wo not you leave me now oh, wo not you leave me now, now? oh nina you should go, nina love will come and love will go cause i ai not never coming home, nina but you can make it on your own oh, wo not you leave me now? sing that song, go oh wo not you leave me now and i have been living on the road, nina people grow and fall apart but then again you should know, nina but you can mend your broken heart cause that’s you and me both, nina oh, wo not you leave me now, now? loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes but it is the only thing that i know when it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes it is the only thing that makes us feel alive  we keep this love in a photograph we made these memories for ourselves where our eyes are never closing our hearts were never broken and time is forever frozen, still  so you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans holding me close until our eyes meet you wo not ever be alone, wait for me to come home  loving can heal, loving can mend your soul and it is the only thing that i know, know i swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya and it is the only thing to take with us when we die  we keep this love in a photograph

roadway, but  i love him from my skin to my bones but i do not wanna live in his home there is nothing to say 'cause he knows i will just runaway and be on my own  i have never seen my dad cry cold as stone in the kitchen light i will tell you it is about time but i was raised to keep quiet this is what i am gonna do gonna runaway, gonna make that move gonna grab clothes and when it is morning, go  "how long you leaving?" well, dad just do not expect me back this evening oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this it is been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but  i love him from my skin to my bones but i do not wanna live in his home there is nothing to say 'cause he knows i will just runaway and be on my own  backpack and a flat cap turned to the back as i packed my clothes up my dad was not down with that plan to attack intends to show love i don’t wanna live this way gonna take my things and go if things change in a matter of days i could be persuaded to hold on mama was the same none of us are saints, i guess that god knows that i do not wanna runaway and one of these days, i might just show that put my home in a suitcase tie both shoe places, and hope that things change, but for now i will leave town with a backpack on my shoulder  i love him from my skin to my bones but i do not wanna live in his home there’s nothing to say 'cause he knows i will just runaway and be on my own now i do not wanna hate you just wish you would never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true, i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he is waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he is not the right guy for you do not hate me 'cause i write the truth no, i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but  it i wo not be changing the subject, i love it i will make your little secret public it is nothing, i am just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i am lacking sleep fact is you are mad at me because i racetrack so casually you are practically my family if we married then i will guess you would have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot? i think not  i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not want you no anymore i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not wanna love you no anymore  recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i am away so much i stay more climate than in a monastery i am not cut out for life on the road 'cause i did not know i would miss you this much and at the time we would just go, so sue me i guess i am not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i have been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that is when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it is hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i am left with is to pick up my personal pieces, jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i will ever have and need i guess i am unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not want you no anymore i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not wanna love you no anymore  and since you left, i have given up my days off it is what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 i feel like writing a book, i guess i lied in the hook 'cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career in music did not exist in 6 years, yeah, you would probably be my wife with a kid i am frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a split i fall into a spiral and it is just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i am trying to kill and i would be writing my will before i am 27, i will die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge, or did i make a mistake erasing ? it is only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i will be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i am not prepared, but i will say this these things happen for a reason and you ca not change  take my apology, i am sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest  i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not want you no anymore i do not love you baby i do not need you baby i do not wanna love you no anymore when your legs do not work like they used to before and i ca not sweep you off of your feet will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? and darling, i will be loving you till we are seventy and baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three and i am thinking 'bout how  people fall in love in mysterious ways maybe just the touch of a hand well me, i fall in love with you every single day i just wanna tell you i am  so honey, now, take me into your loving arms kiss me under the light of a thousand stars place your head on my beating heart, i am thinking out loud and maybe we found love right where we are  when my hair is all but gone and my memory fades and the crowds do not remember my name when my hands do not play the strings the same way i know you will still love me the same 'cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it is evergreen and baby, your smile is forever in my mind and memory and i am thinking 'bout how  people fall in love in mysterious ways and maybe it is all part of a plan well i will just keep on making the same mistakes hoping that you will understand  that, baby, now, take me into your loving arms kiss me under the light of a thousand stars place your head on my beating heart, i am thinking out loud and maybe we found love right where we are  so baby, now, take me into your loving arms kiss me under the light of a thousand stars oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, i am thinking out loud that maybe we found love right where we are oh baby, we found love right where we are and we found love right where we are things were all good yesterday and then the devil took your memory and if you fell to your death today i hope that heaven is your resting place i heard the doctors put your chest in pain but then that could have been the medicine and now you are lying in the bed again either way i will cry with the rest of them  and my father told me "son it is not his fault he does not know your face and you are not the only one" although my grand used to say that he used to sing  darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night and we will lie inside for a little while here, oh i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up and we are wrapped in light and life and love put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut for they are designed to be together, oh with your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one and we are set alight, we are fire love oh love  and things were all good yesterday but then the devil took your breath away and now we are left here in the pain black suit, black tie, standing in the rain and now my family is one again staple together with the strangers and a friend came to my mind, i should paint it with a pen six years old, i remember when  and my father told me "son it is not his fault he does not know your face and you are not the only one" although my grand used to say that he used to sing  darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night and we will lie inside for a little while here, oh i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up and we are wrapped in light and life and love put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut for they are designed to be together, oh with your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one and we are set alight, we are fire love oh love  and my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah and my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah and my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah and all my brother and my sisters and my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah i am not a rapper, i am a singer with a flow i have got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know you will find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision signed to a label but did not listen to any criticism thought you knew but you did not, so per your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i am driven and now it is onto the next saga, we drink the best lager i will never try to win you over like your stepfather i will do my own thing now and get respect after and i am avoiding the 'cane like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it is safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old, yeah, i moved out of my home i was may gray, i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination, i do not wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax? i will take it back now  mm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us do not you fade into the back, love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack, i will be singing the news try act like jack black when i bring it to school i will make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i will give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an oral fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that is what they are supposed to do and i am supposed to be calm, i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering, "everything that happens is from now on" i will be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they are claiming that i handle it wrong but then i have never had an enemy except the nme but i will be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i am battling for respect, and i do not know if i will have it this song is from the heart, covered the planet, i will take it back now  mm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us do not you fade into the back, love no, i will take it back now  now, i do not ever wanna be perfect 'cause i am a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone is gotta win worst-dressed taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dayton considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart acre but drinking absentee can change your mind state vividly, need to let my liver be and i will say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it is good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that is how it is supposed to be, i am screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life is dreams, but but i just write schemes i am never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be, but more likely you will find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with madrid, discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we will never betray the way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down that is how we plan it out, it is time to take it back now  mm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us do not you fade into the back, love no mm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us do not you fade into the back, love no  my dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme till i deliver the hype, am i just living a lie? with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me we forget 90 percent of it when we wake but the other 10 percent, it never fades dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i could not just control that thought you would find me busting on the street when it was cold outdoors now i am sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit you ca not fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i am not a rapper, i am a singer, i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit, that is just the way it is dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the utmost faith in it tread your own path, you will never make it as a follower you will never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow high! i can taste salt water and if i blink again you’ll be sinking in so we will learn to swim in the oceans you made i will hold ya and you think of him and pretty soon you’ll be floating away  and i’ll hold on to the words you spoke of anchored down in my throat, love and i’m captain of the sinking boat, now with just one farmland to carry me home  when salted tears won’t dry i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes these hearts will be flooded tonight i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  i still taste salt water on my lips from your kiss of bitterness and i will drown within the oceans you made and i hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up i’ll never trust you again you can just be a friend  and i’ll hold on to the words you spoke of anchored down in my throat, love and i’m captain of the sinking boat, now with just one farmland to carry me home  when salted tears won’t dry i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes these hearts will be flooded tonight i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes  your eyes, your lips, your mouth your thighs, your back, you drive me wild tonight, the fact is i i’m on my way home on the way home i lied, i tried to cry but i’m- i’m drowning in the oceans you made  when salted tears won’t dry i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes these hearts will be flooded tonight i’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes your eyes, your eyes, your eyes it is alright to cry even my dad does sometimes so do not wipe your eyes tears remind you you are alive it is alright to die 'cause death is the only thing you have not tried but just for tonight, hold on  so live life like you are giving up 'cause you act like you are go ahead and just live it up go on and tear me apart  it is alright to shake even my hand does sometimes so inside we will rage against the dying of the light it is alright to say that death is the only thing you have not tried but just for today, hold on  so live life like you’re giving up 'cause you act like you are go ahead and just live it up go on and tear me apart, and hold on so live life like you are giving up 'cause you act like you are go ahead and just live it up go on and tear me apart, and hold on oh mist eye of the mountain below

the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately, her face seems slowly sinking, wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us  'cause we are just under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and she do not want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly  ripped gloves, raincoat tried to swim and stay afloat dry house, wet clothes loose change, bank notes weary-eyed, dry throat call girl, no phone  and they say she is in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately, her face seems slowly sinking, wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us  'cause we are just under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and she do not want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly  an angel will die covered in white closed eyes and hoping' for a better life this time, we will fade out tonight straight down the line  and they say she is in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately, her face seems slowly sinking, wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us  and we are all under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and we do not want to go outside tonight and in a pipe we fly to the motherland or sell love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly for angels to die i wanna be drunk when i wake up on the right side of the wrong bed and never an excuse i made up tell you the truth i hate what did not kill me, it never made me stronger at all love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me so now i will maybe lean back there i am sat here, wishing i was sober i know i will never hold you like i used to  but our house gets cold when you cut the heating without you to hold i will be freezing ca not rely on my heart to beat it cause you take part of it every evening take words out of my mouth just from breathing replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?' should i, should i?  maybe i will get drunk again i will be drunk again i will be drunk again to feel a little love  i wanna hold your heart in both hands not watch you file at the bottom of a coke can and i have got no plans for the weekend so should we speak then? keep it between friends? though i know you will never love me, like you used to there may be other people like us will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up flames just create us, burns do not heal like before you do not hold me anymore  on cold days, cold plays out like the band is name i know i ca not heal things with a handshake you know i ca not change, as i began saying you cut me wide open like a landscape open bottles of beer but never champagne to applaud you with the sound that my hands make should i? should i?  maybe i will get drunk again i will be drunk again i will be drunk again to feel a little love  all by myself i am here again all by myself you know i will never change all by myself all by myself  i am just drunk again i will be drunk again i will be drunk again to feel a little love i found your hairband on my bedroom floor the only evidence that you have been here before and i do not get waves of missing you anymore they are more like tsunami tides in my eyes never getting dry, so i get high smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on weeks pass in the blink of an eye and i am still drunk at the end of the night i do not drink like everybody else i do it to forget things about myself stumble and fall with head spin i have got my mind is with you but my heart is just not  so am i close to you anymore if it is over and there is no chance that we will work it out?  that is why you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied  everybody said we would be together forever but i know that i never wanna settle down, come around break up the love like lego now never wanna turn into another "like you" sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views everything’s great, not everything’s sure but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus now i am in position to be another stalker like every thing i say seems to always sound awkward like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous on the surface and i am always saying everyday that it was worth it pain is only relevant if it still hurts i forget like an elephant, or we can use a negative and go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  so am i close to you anymore if it is over and there is no chance that we will work it out?  oh, you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied  because, if i was gonna go somewhere i would be there by now and maybe i can let myself down wo-oath and thinking i am unaware, i keep my feet on the ground keep looking around, to make sure i am not, the only one to feel low because if you want, i will take you in my arms and keep you sheltered from all that i have done wrong and i will know you will say, that i am the only one but i know god made another one of me to love you better than i ever will  'cause you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that is fine but you are the only one that knows i lied my mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner my eyes are the color of red like a sunset i will never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner be a true heart, not

eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i will hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i am just in love when you wake me up  and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrew 'cause we have watched it 12 times and maybe you are hoping for a fairy-tale too and if your dvd breaks today you should have got a var because i have never owned a blu-ray, true say i know i have always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost, i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i

in love when you wake me up  and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so i’ll take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i will make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i will carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and

the woman i love down by the webform border she was nancy sullivan and i was william sheeran she took my name and then we were one down by the webform border  well, i met her at guy is in the second world war and she was working on a soldier is ward never had i seen such beauty before the moment that i saw her nancy was my yellow rose and we got married wearing borrowed clothes we got eight children, now growing old five sons and three daughters  she and i went on the run do not care about religion i am gonna marry the woman i love down by the webform border she was nancy sullivan and i was william sheeran she took my name and then we were one down by the webform border  from her snow white streak in her jet black hair over sixty years i have been loving her now we are sat by the fire in our old armchair you know nancy, i odore ya from a farm boy born near belfast town i never worried about the king and crown 'cause i found my heart upon the southern ground there is no difference, i assure ya  she and i went on the run do not care about religion i am gonna marry the woman i love down by the webform border she was nancy sullivan and i was william sheeran she took my

same for me? oh, honestly? offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm they gave me the headache and in return i gave a song it goes on and on  life can get you down so i just num the way it feels i drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell so before i save someone else, i have got to save myself  i gave you all my energy and i took away your pain 'cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain what line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same and only scars remain  life can get you down so i just num the way it feels i drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell so before i save someone else, i have got to save myself  but if i do not then i will go back to where i am rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that oh,

flowers that breathe jet tagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep although my blood shot whites and iris is they never find any clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many although my eyes are heavy they wo not be closing soon cos i know that time waits for nobody, i suppose its true we make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths to see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves i say what ever i feel to vent a rhyme so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine cos we all recognise, real is what my father says and i will be sticking to this phrase until i pass away overlooking, no sleep is just another way to die slow but i will just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close dealing 5 o'clock with lights off interview with a vampire sleep is for the living and not a utensils that i require i swear i said, that i will sleep when im dead whos on the beat upon the feature with ed its d-e-v to the z over tired, pale faced like michael myers bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i have acquired and over the time within this maze i will think you will find you will never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying cup i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game its time to wage war scissors, grab a sword, and sharper up your hunting knives 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight i am having from the essex and the east london border line villains never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes be wide awake just like your sorting lines or get left fortified like you just seen the ghost of jesus walking by i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ah the times i am living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be the times i am living in lately i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out deliver the raps how i flow i live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong but they wo not either in too easy, believe me im snake minded be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillow some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow opposite of sober cos i never did my homework which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie i wake dead, take deep breath, try to never die! never die dealing 2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge making metaphors flow and move, like typhoon and tunes and if we got our eyes on you, we will catch you while you snooker times leasing while your catching z is, the masses like to move we scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do driven young gentlemen i have hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i have not slept in them, true! im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em we got the fans all like 'oh wow its its devs and ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got i keep my pupils engaged like a classroom in holy matrimonio but im only trying to stay awake i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ah the times i am living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4 the times i am living in lately hey, can you hear me i just wanted to let you know, hmm  i hope you can hear what i write to you how could i say goodbye to you? when i am a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you i gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day rest in life in you working but you were never stress free just locked in a cage saving they said they were gold in the pavement but you came and saw the road to amusement broke your heart but still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast i hope your listening right i still think of you every sunday no one can top your chicken and rice even through the darkness times you held us all up because your vision was bright i knew your strength was your wisdom inside you never let anyone see your headache you just got on with it anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful and your words you would stand strong with it cause they were like warmth on a winter night but i was just too young to go on with it and there something i could try to do but it is an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you i could not do that, i owe my life to you  and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign, i hope this pain will heal in time you know i never want to be alo-oh-oh-one i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and will you think of me up there? can i say goodbye to you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or feel the chill of your warm embrace? can i say goodbye to you? oh  i think you phone i was younger with the knowledge of things that i know now i would be by your side when you needed me instead of asking you "nan can i go out?" standing in a road with the gangs that i know now everyone is missing you loads, jessica is grown up warren, lauren and alex are fine and i am living with hope it is been a while since i have seen c and the mouths i miss seeing a family, being a family and us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time goes by, the bridge seems longer family problems have never been funny in my heart the only one that missed me was sonia she took all our inheritance money left the rest of us to pick up the pieces i never forgive the way she betrayed us there ai not a big enough reason before i sell out my fam i will be giving up breathing but i guess that everyone is different or should i say no one is perfect? she had happiness in front of her but chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing since you gone the foundations stumbled so building it back up is my next step i got all the bricks and the cement but it is hard when it is done, i do not know what to expect so give me the strength that i need to perform this task make it right, i must do and i ask cause i trust you it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you  and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign, i hope this pain will heal in time you know i never want to be alo-oh-oh-one i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and will you think of me up there? can i say goodbye to you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or feel the chill of your warm embrace? can i say goodbye to you? oh  it is just for now so i should hush i will never get enough, i will see you when i see you but i miss you, oh how i miss you it is just for now so i should hush i will never get enough, i will see you when i see you but i miss you, oh how i miss you  there ai not enough words to describe how sorry i am for the pain that i caused sorry for when i stuck up my own blood we were young and he said it was raping his broad and for the day police came to the door i am sorry for being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and making you mourn i never been able to say this before cause i was so inconsiderate you loved me unconditionally and i took advantage of it like a idiot not seeing the pure soul that i was living with i really hope that you can forgive me you going away was a punishment but i wo not let go i am holding you with me but i still fight the emotions within me  i can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and will you think of me up there? and can i say goodbye to you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down your face feel the chill of your warm embrace? and can i say goodbye to you? i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and will you think of me up there? can i say goodbye to you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or feel the chill of your warm embrace? can i say goodbye to you? 1. p money- pagans everywhere 2. ksi & turkish dcypha-

listen, little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it is 30 degrees, thursday you work late, you was with a per making dirty fake love in his mercedes lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night you wanna get up but you know your legs will acre if you try and you remember that your punter went crazy last night you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for you will make a trip to the whittington where they will look at your jaw they will be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure they will know you are finding if you tell them you got hit by a door but young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker medical attention could be fatal cause the count would not ever let a doctor near someone that is getting dough for him cause next you got proxy authorities sticking their noses in  she is just under the upper hand and goes mad for a couple grams and she do not wanna go outside, tonight 'cause, in a pipe, she will fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly  little lady, your mind you have made up your injuries you ca not hide with make-up you need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just in case the doc opens his eyes and do not decide to play dumb with any luck you will see the same dude who stitched your top lip last year when your pimp just lost it he would not recognise you if you started him in the face anyway 'cause all the heroin is making you age but you are a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag the funds you have left go where your from using monogram mother had to get you out the motherland to study that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand little does she know you are never coming back she put you in her brother is hands, only for him to formulate another plan he is the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer fancy that, you came to london to get piped by your uncle, damn  she is just under the upper hand and goes mad for a couple grams and she do not wanna go outside, tonight 'cause, in a pipe, she will fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly  now an angel will die, covered in white with closed eyes and hoping for a better life this time now, we will fade out tonight straight down the line  little lady, you are troubling with fear your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer you are sitting facing the detective, oh, dear the meddling nurse could not just leave it she is only gone and made it much worse calling police in she will never know the gravity of the damage she is caused you are causing scandal going mad in the ward now the cop is trying to calm you, telling you he wo not let no one harm you the same question he keeps trying to ask you, "who you working for?" he is talking to you like you are worth more than a dirty whore you are having a conversation you could be murdered for you are learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court he is kicking knowledge you ai not ever heard before just before he leaves, he reassure you that he knows that it is hard he underline a mobile number you can phone on his card begs you to use it, he is useless if you are gonna be stupid 'cause an answer has not come from your bruised lips, you are on your own you have gotta go and give your pimp what you owe you reach your door and then it dans that you have been followed home before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat and then a voice says, "where you been, bitch? i wanna know" no prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness you open the front door, he boots you in there is something new in him, he is silent now, that fills you with terror get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error he towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight at this point, your life flashes before your eyes your handball is dropped and all the contents are all over the floor despite the mess there is only one thing that has caught his eye and in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece and dumps her body in the boot of his mercy in the street little lady left this earth in the worst way all because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday  and we are all under the upper hand and going mad for a couple grams and we do not wanna go outside, tonight 'cause, in a pipe, she will fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it is too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly and fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly and angels to die i do not want cruise your ears or

the spices of china lucy walked gently between the damp barrels and shut out my eyes with the width of her fingers said she would guessed the number of bales in the back room  while the seagulls were screaming lucy was eating then we hauled up our colours the way the mother had told us and together we just watched the sails  lucy i said in a passage of cotton legs can we hold hands i am sure that it is warmer then the gulls ate the crumbs of lucy is sandwich  while the seagulls were screaming lucy was eating then we hauled up our colours the way the mother had told us and together we just

anyway  for this dark and lonely room projects a shadow cast in gloom and my eyes are mirrors of the world outside thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide and these shadows turn from purple into grey  for just a skyline pigeon dreaming of the open waiting for the day he can spread his wings fly away again  fly away, skyline pigeon, fly towards the dreams you have left so very far behind fly away, skyline pigeon, fly towards the dreams you have left so very far behind  just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new own hay to laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day i wanna hear the dealing bells of distant churches sing but most of all, please free me from this acting metal ring and open out this cage towards the sun  for just a skyline pigeon dreaming of the open waiting for the day he can spread his wings and fly away again  fly away, skyline pigeon, fly towards the things you have left so very far behind fly away, skyline pigeon,

only tears  the tales that i told round the fire every night are out of proportion and none of them right she is harmless and empty of anything bad for she once had something that most of you have

all across the havens to the waterfall they told me i would meet her there inside those icy walls but how on earth in this universe can they forgive me of my pains for all across the havens i must stumble locked in chains  then the mother of mercy showed me her stable and told me you would be safe safe in her cradle and the waterfall opened and the water withdrew leaving me standing on a road leading through  all across the havens to the waterfall they told me that i would meet her there inside those icy walls but how on earth in this universe can they forgive me of my pains for all across the havens i must stumble locked in chains hey there look in the mirror are you afraid you might see me looking at you waiting, waiting at windows oh it is me that you need yes it is me and i am

each other  i can see you sitting, eating apples in the evening the fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly down the bronze of your body  living like a lust flower running through the grass for hours rolling through the hay, oh like a puppy, child  and when it rains, the rain falls down washing out the cattle town and she is far away somewhere in her eiderdown and she dreams of crystal streams of days gone by when we would lean laughing, fit to burst upon each other  oh, if only i could castle in the cradle of your cabin my arm is around your shoulder, who the window is wide and open while the swallow and the sycamore, who are playing in the valley oh, i miss you, amoreena like the king bee misses honey  and when it rains, the rain falls down washing out the cattle town and

nothing to steal so, there is not a great deal of crime  it sure is hell living in a one horse town there is half a mile of alabama mud bed ground nothing much doing of an afternoon unless you are sitting in a rocking chair, just picking a tune  and they are not too well acquainted with the stars and stripes but if you want to hear susan, then they will pick all night they will pick all night  because it is no dice living in a one horse town laid back, as my old soon hound and i just ca not wait to get out of this one horse town there is nothing to steal cause there is simply nothing much around the last i heard of you you were somewhere on a cruise in mediterranean so imagine my surprise to see you very much alive in the english rain again  and i can still recall wet afternoons when we were small and simply childish but you have created your own ghost and the need you have is more than most to hide it  oh, chameleon, you are stealing your way back into my eyes beyond a shadow of a doubt, you are a devil, you are a devil in disguise do you really change me or am i going crazy? chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you are free again, my child  i remember still those lazy summer days we would kill out hunting danger and we were alien to all outsiders we had no desire to talk to strangers  chameleon crime in the streets i read about it everyday in the papers and justice needs and justice wants  but just in times, yes, too late here oh, feels like i was not born there feels like i was not born there i feel just like a boogie pilgrim, oh, huh, yeah  boogie pilgrim, hustle to get it, to get it together down on the live talk, down on the weather boogie pilgrim, oh, brother i never felt better no, i never felt better  low life is complete when you have lived that way out on the sidewalk walking on the sidewalk everyday oh, i got the speed, baby, you got the need, ah,uh  but the need in me needs nothing but you know that i need nothing but i know that you all want something oh, just like boogie pilgrim, boogie pilgrim  yeah, i know i am better do not you know that i never felt better no, i am never, never, never felt better do not you know that i never felt

know that i never felt better  boogie pilgrim sober in the morning light things look so much different to how they looked last night a pale face pressed to an made bed like flags of many nations flying high above her head the cellphone still on the flowers the telegram still in her hand as whispers circulate all day their back-stage baby princess passed away  and you can cage the songid but you ca not make her sing and you can trap the free bird but you will have to clip her wings because she will soar like a hawk when she flies but she will dive like an eagle when she dies  promises of no more lies fell flat upon an empty stage before the audience arrived a return in time to the cheaper seats she never knew what lay beneath just a dated handball they found between the sheets let down before the final curtain a shallow heart that left her cold she left in rouge upon the mirror a circled kiss to the faithful fans who would miss her on a bench, on the beach just before the sun had gone i tried to reach you, plain faced and falling fast you looked so vacant like an empty shell whose life had passed upon the ocean before light shook the sky, down by the docks i saw the masts unfolding do not turn away, please understand, it is a life and a living and a way to keep the wolves away from hungry hands, from hungry hands  crazy water takes my fishing boat on monday morning dangerous dreaming if we all believe in the things you believe you are seeing oh, we would never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water  tangled lives, lonely wives shoreline widows pray for the souls of missing whalers endless nights on an endless sea where nothing lives between us just the breakers on the ocean separating you and me, ooh, separating you and me  crazy water  in the crazy, crazy water in the crazy, crazy, crazy water crazy, crazy, crazy water now, it was just like frankie and johnny and it was just like stage lee dolly summers was a simple girl from a mid-west family with a stucco home and her own mustang and a charge account at sears she had everything that a girl could want to live happy for the rest of her years but the thing that she wanted most of all was the thing that she had lost to the arms of a downtown black jack hustle by the name of candy loss they would slipped town on a late night train heading for the west dolly slipped behind the wheel of her mustang with a piece between her breast  she put a pistol in her shoulder bolster she took her car up from santa fe yesterday morning she was washing dishes now she is hunting down a runaway do not judge a man by a misdemeanor you may be sorry when his light goes out do not put that pistol in your shoulder bolster you can never, never tell if the law is about  if it seemed just like a movie or a night of bad tv they should have had a picture of dolly is face as she drove across the country with daggers drawn for her fallen man an venom in her heart it was nearly dawn when she caught them up making out in a picnic park but the thing that shook her rigid as she fumbled for her gun was the state of the man that she would married once and thought of as the only one and as she looked back on the chances that she would passed up at home well, she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch and she headed home alone  you can never, never tell if the law is about what have i gotta do to make you love me? what have i gotta do to make you care? what do i do when lightning strikes me? and i wake to find that you are not there  what do i do to make you want me? what have i gotta do to be heard? what do i say when it is all over? and sorry seems to be the hardest word  it is sad, so sad so sad it is a sad, sad situation and it is getting more and more absurd it is sad, so sad so sad why ca not we talk it over? oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word  it is sad, so sad so sad it is a sad, sad situation and it is getting more and more absurd it is sad, so sad so sad why ca not we talk it over? oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word  what do i do to make you love me? oh, what have i gotta do to be heard? what do i do when lightning strikes me? what have i gotta do? what have i gotta do? ooh, and sorry seems to be the hardest word i wonder who is sleeping in your sheets tonight whose head rests upon the bed could it be a close friend i knew so well who seems to be so close to you instead close to you instead  i am blue tonight, i am red when i am mad i am green when i am jealous, yellow when i am sad i guess i cannot have everything so much has flown between the years when i was twenty and you were seventeen  so out of choice i chose rock and roll but it pushed me to the limit everyday it turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home from there on, there seemed no use for you for you to stay  and if i shower around 3 a.m it is just to wash away the trace of a love unwanted oh in the times i went astray the times i went astray  ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh so much has flown between the years when i was twenty and you were seventeen are you still in control of the boat that you row or do you still cling to me when its sinking i never condemned you, i only console you when candlelight made me a king  for the wide-eyed and laughing passed like a season, erasing a passion to sin for no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarot that the wide-eyed and laughing were just one step ahead of the wind  and the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me was a song that i would heard in the past for i had an audience somewhere inside you that applauded whenever you laughed  gone is a word that i now rarely use though sometime in the course of a day i go racing back like a man possessed by the wide-eyed and laughing daughters of some different age he died when the house was empty when the maid had gone he put a pen to paper for one final song he wrote, "oh babe, it is the only way i know it is wrong but i ca not stand to go on living to go on living living life this way"  "and i do not know what the time is or what the next line is or how you are gonna take the news but if i had my life again i would not change a thing i would let nobody, i would let nobody stand inside my shoes"  "oh something is gotten hold of me this home is not the home it used to be i have gathered dust like the dying flowers and i have drunk myself sober after hours and hours" "oh something is gotten hold of me this home is not the home it used to be it is not the same i have gathered dust like the dying flowers ooh and i have drunk myself sober ooh after hours and hours" "ooh after hours and hours" shoorah  she grows, she is grown like campus tall in the wind, she is simple and spiteful she is all girl, woman and

hungry there is so many big men they are out making millions when poverty is profits just blame the children  if there is a god in heaven what is he waiting for? if he ca not hear the children then he

their hands they need the handouts to hold back the tears there is so many crying but so few that hear  if there is a god in heaven well, what is he waiting for? oh, he was a light star tripping on a high wire bulldog stubborn born uneven a classes creature a man for all seasons but do not bet them they ca not take him to the very bottom because they made him and they will waste him and i do not believe that i want to watch them  because the fifties shifted out of gear he was an idol then now he is an idol here but his face has changed he is not the same no more and i have to say that i like

depth of your despair you went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes to peanuts from the lion is share alright  because the fifties shifted out of gear he was an idol then now he is an idol here

sometimes hard to find your way but maybe some night you might think of me, shooting star and when that moment comes at last and you remember who you are  here i will be, shooting star, shooting star the fuse is set and checked once more then left beside a back street door and in the cold gray light, someone sees a shadow run through the night and out of sight they hide inside a smoke filled room to hear at last the blast of doom and so the deed is done, they listen to the final countdown begun, three, two, one madness, it is a kind of madness that turns good men bad and we are helpless, caught up in the madness of a world gone mad the roar of fire rings out on high and flames light up the black night sky a child screams out in fear, a hopeless cry for help but no one is near enough to hear as walls collapse and timbers flare the smell of death hangs in the air when help at last arrives they try to fight the flame but nothing survives of all those lives  and it is madness, every time a victim dies there is madness, burning in a blind man is eyes and it is madness, hidden in the hate and pain there is madness, burning in a wild man is brain  and it is madness, every time the bullets start there is madness, burning in a poor man is heart and it is madness, something that we ca not control there is madness, burning in a madman is soul, madness life is not everything is not everything is not everything  life is not everything is not everything is not everything  life is not everything is not everything is not everything  life, life, life, life life, life, life, life,

someone shot through the tyre swing the dogs marked and based in the winter and spring and the ivy that hung now sadly cling to a dying season and i cry at night when the lights go out and the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts from road maps and red lines to lipstick lies and when the lights go out it is thought to survive this man holds a hand that shows a treble this man that i live in bears his faults he has a heart and a well worn soul ten years a slave to rock and roll but he has to treble for the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn and just like your love that is come and gone it goes on breathing i have been blown away like a printed page that reads "you are lovesick" headline news had me so abused but i was lovesick you never

just a knack strangers, after all, we find we are strangers after all this time we have made the long and the lonely climb and now we have reached the part where we find we are strangers we were strangers from the start two people caught in the tide on the edge of love and pride and both afraid to approach the side and fall again two people playing the part but which is life and which is art

sack sat beneath the tree by the railroad track an engineer could see him sitting in the shade streaming with the rhythm that the drivers made the people passing by, they would stop and say oh my, how

that acting feeling to look up one another one more time tracking down the zip codes sealing down those envelopes lack of communication on the telephone line but do not judge us by distance or the difference between us try to look at it with an open mind for where there is one room, you will always find another two rooms at the end of the world well we have both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon borne our swords like steel knights on the highway washing down the dirt roads housing off our dirty clothes coming to terms with the times that we could not but we tried  where there is one room, you will always find another two rooms at the end of the world  door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together their rooms are different temperatures i am told there is a change in their thinking and their habits seem uneven but together the two of them were mining gold  but where there is one room, you will always find another two rooms at the end of the world  two rooms at the end of the world dust settles on a thin cloud sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd i have had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours staring at a line of white powder high-priced madness pays the tab i have scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag i am a catatonic son of a bitch who is had a touch too much of white powder  and she is a habit i ca not handle for a reason i ca not say i am in love with a wild white lady she is as sweet as the stories say  white powder, white lady you are one and the same come on down to my house wo not you and hit this boy again  white powder white powder white lady white lady you are one and the same come on down to my house, wo not you? and hit this boy again  shock waves to a tired brain sends that hungry lady to my door again she is my shelter from the storm when i feel the rain entertaining white powder i feel i am dry-docked and tongue-tied heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride i might just escape while the others might die riding on a high of white powder  i feel i am dry-docked and tongue-tied heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride i might just escape while the others might die riding on a high of white powder  white powder white lady white lady hit this boy again dear god, are you there can you hear me, do you care dear god, here are we less than perfect, far from free  oh we take what we

and i built it wide i left no room for doubt your love still found its way inside and could not get back out i am breaking down the barriers making up my mind i am breaking down the barriers of time i am taking down the barriers and loving what i find i am breaking down the barriers that lie between your love and mine i guess you know you were not the first you may not be the last but you have shown me a better way and now i am learning fast you got to go where the feeling flows i take it while it is hot you got to give if you want to get and i want all you got i have got a good by-line,

remember belgium and the brussels museum where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers our code of living meant little to others the few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs  but the red lights where the cat fights make it just like belgium see us face down on the floor of another cheap bedroom streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change and your sweet madame makes it seem just like belgium  just like a hustle when they look attractive it is nothing more than a slap on the back the price tag of being just a little bit different the first rule to learn is to keep your own distance  but the red lights where the cat fights make it just like belgium see us face down on the floor of another cheap bedroom streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change and your sweet madame makes it seem just like belgium just like belgium  oh, it is just like belgium is not that just like belgium oh, it is just like belgium is not that just like belgium they must have loved each other once but that was many years ago and by the time i came along things were already going wrong i felt the pain in their pretense the side they tried hard not to show but through the simple eyes of youth it was not hard to see the truth  and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and it is the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins, the game nobody wins  they must have loved each other once before the magic slipped away and as their life became a lie what love remained began to die i used to hide beneath the sheets i prayed that time would find a way but with the passing of the years i watched as laughter turned to tears  and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and it is the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins, the game nobody wins  we used to love each other once with all the passion we possessed but people change as time goes by some feelings grow while others die but if we learn from what we see and face the truth while we still can then though the passion may be gone some kind of love can still live on  and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and it is the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins, the game nobody wins  nobody wins, nobody wins la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la and it is the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins, the game nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins i read about how you are slow with the truth like any old also is fable but when you are burlesque, i am a hare is breath into payment under the table but some journalist got his mug shot kit and his briefcase on his lap but i am tired of being linked with the k.g.b and all that political crap  because i have seen your fascist faces on the cover of the national papers staring out in black and white from the tall gray walls on the other side when i see your fascist faces then i know i have had enough trying to trace it or erase it is it foolproof or a bluff  if the boy had been blessed he would have been arrested on a charge of wearing red shoes but if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose it will make you a patriot through and through  when i see your fascist faces just like a broken marriage, when two people just do not care like when the cupboard is empty or there is no food in the frigidaire  i am a page from the end of the story no closer to my hope and glory just a kick away from the heels of the wind  how come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born  and just for the sake of all these reasons rains wash out the fires within fires that help to keep you moving just a kick away from the heels of the wind  you do not deserve that treatment, i ca not pretend i was that nice i am no e ticket ride to disneyland, i am no bushy first class flight i am a day behind your restless wings you, you rather have the wealth of kings me, i would rather be on the heels of the wind  and just for the sake of all these reasons rains wash out the fires within the fires that help to keep you moving just a kick away from the heels of the wind  and just for the sake of all these reasons rains wash out the fires within fires that help to keep you moving just a kick away from the heels of the wind  just a kick away from the heels of the wind well mama, just a kick away, just a kick away just a kick away from the heels of the wind staring all alone and your grace and style cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile i watched you playing pool it is all around the school that i love you i love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes always unprepared for your pointed replies cynical and lean i lie awake and dream about you  if you only knew what i am going through time and again i get ashamed to say your name it is hard to grin and bear when you are standing there my lips are dry, i catch your eye and look away  sitting in my room, i have got it bad crying for the moon, they think i am mad they say it is not real but i know what i feel and i love you  if you only knew what i am going through time and again i get ashamed to say your name it is hard to grin and bear when you are standing there my lips are dry, i catch your eye and look away  sitting in my room, i have got it bad crying for the moon, they think i am mad but i would give my life for a single night beside you being wire and thinking loudly about the things sent to make you move you ca not help it, there is no one in the world knows you just, just the way you do  so we keep dating through the holes as the hunter and the fox run the gauntlet is savage road  winter is heavy and partly cloudy and the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few bit if you are riley, you will leave them lying shared up in the traps that they set for you and it is an evergreen affair as temptation taunts the fox into the hunter is waiting lair  and for mile after mile you will never see me tire you will never see me slow down, for a while because i am the fox, like it or not  i am always going to be there running over the rock yes i am the fox, a fascinating cross of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox yes i am the fox  it may sound crazy but it is often lonely and the restless heart should be captured once in a while then you can use them, and you often fool them into believing whatever you desire  so i will keep moving through the night the hunter and the hunted on their designated flights  the designated flights i got home today, took a look around trying to find that girl of mine, she could not be found all her things were gone, she just left a note it do not take no mastermind to figure what she wrote  she said, "dear john, i am moving on by this time i am going to be long gone dear john, c'est la vie, dear john so long, you have seen the last of me"  i do not want her back, i wo not even try this time is not just au revid, this time it is goodbye we could not go on, living like we were i was just about to write a  boulder john' note to her  i was going to say, "dear john, i am moving on by this time i am going to be long gone dear john, c'est la vie, dear john so long, you have seen the last of me"  she said, "dear john, i am moving on by this time i am going to be long gone dear john, c'est la vie, dear john so long, you have seen the last of me"  dear john, i am moving on, by this time i am going to be long gone, dear john, c'est la vie, dear john, so long dear john, i am moving on, by this time i am going to be long gone, dear john, c'est la vie, dear john, so long i do not want to worry you none but i got the hurt on the run i just cut out the poison that was in me so long watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part oh i have been shaken down by a spiteful child i have slapped a worried brown on that evil smile i have been taken down by a spiteful child i have turned the tables round and it drives you wild oh you spiteful child  you would better be ready to run, now i have got you under the gun i put my money on vengeance before this race had begun breaking the spirit in me only added to your concept playing you at your own game is going to make it complete  oh i have been shaken down by a spiteful child turn the tables round and it drives you wild oh you spiteful child  spiteful i got a ball and chain hanging around my heart you were the one to blame for tearing my world apart i got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice a little more love from you, it could have been paradise  i got a ball and chain hanging around my heart and if it is all the same maybe we should part and i am singing do do do i am singing do do do  you had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt i am sick of being kicked around so this is where i get out  oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly driving me insane oh oui baby  i could not take your pain, you could not take my love so i am going to quit this game `cause baby i have had enough  i got a ball and chain hanging around my heart  and i am singing do do do i am singing do do do your accountant called this morning there was springtime in his heart he could not wait to tell me how he would pulled our lives apart and the letter from your lawyer lies opened on the tray i may get around to reading it later today walking round the lonely rooms i see everything the same but suddenly it matters what was purchased in my name whether this or that was paid for belongs to me or you can the seven years together be divided by two  it says something for the legal boys but nothing much for us that all we had together is so quickly ended thus the legal boys have won again and you and i have lost they ca not tell us how it happened but they will let us know the cost oh they will let us know the cost, oh yeah  there is a lot i would like to tell you but i ca not get past your guards i do not speak their language and they hold all the cards i would rather call you darling than defendant in the case but lovers left here long ago and clients took their place i have been beating aboard her for a light year from a strange craft she is got a subtle touch on the silver key to a clockwork heart  i am your robot  i am your robot man i am your robot  i am your robot man  you went and flipped the switch and turned me positive when i was negative i have been stumbling around like a metal man on the graveyard shift  i am your robot and i am programmed to love you my serial number is 44357  i am your robot blue eyes baby is got blue eyes like a deep, blue sea on a blue, blue day blue eyes baby is got blue eyes when the morning' comes i will be far away and i say  blue eyes, holding' back the tears holding' back the pain baby is got blue eyes and she is alone again  blue eyes baby is got blue eyes like a clear, blue sky watching' over me blue eyes ooh, i love blue eyes when i am by her side where i long to be i will see  blue eyes, laughing' in the sun laughing' in the rain baby is got blue eyes and i am home, and i am home again  blue eyes, laughing' in the sun laughing' in the rain baby is got blue eyes and i am home again what happened here as the new york sunset disappeared? i found an empty garden among the flagstones there who lived here? he must have been a gardener that cared a lot who needed out the tears and grew a good crop now it all looks strange it is funny how one insect can damage so much grain  and what is it for? this little empty garden by the brownstone door and in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothing' grows no more who lived here? he must have been a gardener that cared a lot who needed out the tears and grew a good crop and we are so amazed, we are crippled and we are dated a gardener like that one, no one can replace  and i have been knocking', but no one answers and i have been knocking' most of the day oh, and i have been calling', "oh, hey, hey, johnny ca not you come out to play?"  and through their tears some say he farmed his best in younger years but he would have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear who lived there? he must have been a gardener that cared a lot who needed out the tears and grew a good crop now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls we hear, we hear your name  and i have been knocking', but no one answers and i have been knocking' most of the day oh, and i have been calling', "oh, hey, hey, johnny ca not you come out to play?"  and i have been knocking', but no one answers and i have been knocking' most of the day oh, and i have been calling', "oh, hey, hey, johnny ca not you come out? can you come out to play?"  johnny, ca not you come out to play in your empty garden? johnny, ca not you come

you are my princess you are my princess have not you heard them say i was a prisoner buried alive now suddenly i have been freed but love is the sweets way oh i was lonely and now you are the only lover that i will ever need see the changes here on every street as time goes marching to a different beat moving on into the restless age as the kids today find their feet long enough to hold on young enough to chase our dreams we were captured by romantic things touched by love until it made us cry how our hearts could fly without wings  oh wo not somebody tell me tell me where have all the good times gone say that you remember remember all those good old four tops songs wo not somebody tell me where have all the good times gone  stolen moments in the smoky room monday mornings that would come too soon crazy summers that would never end when the time was spent loving you yeah we had a good time some things never seem to last ai not it funny how we missed the past love has changed but the clock still turns while the flame still burns for you  they have gone away gone they have gone away  they have gone away  it is hard enough to lose the game and sad to see it played again what makes you happy for a while is gonna make you smile through the rain  wo not you please tell me where have all the good times gone all quiet on the western front, nobody saw a youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth see the stems of europe bend under force  all quiet all quiet all quiet on the western front  so tired of this garden is grief, nobody cares old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir see the russian offense fly, were not we grand to place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands  all quiet all quiet all quiet on the western front  it is gone all quiet on the western front, male angels sigh ghosts float in a flooded trench as germany dies fever reads the flowers of france, fair-haired boys string the harp to victory is voice, joyous noise  all quiet all quiet all quiet on the western front all quiet all quiet all quiet on the western front we still sit at separate tables and we sleep at different times and the warm wind in the palm trees has not helped to change our minds it was the lure of the tropics that i thought might heal the scars of a love burned out by silence in a marriage minus heart  and i call the kids on the telephone say there is something wrong out here it is july but it is cold as christmas in the middle of the year  the temperature is up to ninety five but there is a winter look in your mother is eyes and to melt the tears there is a heat wave here so how come it is cold as christmas in the middle of the year?  i dreamed of love in a better climate and for what it is really worth i put faith in the star we followed to this caribbean surf but there is an icy fringe on everything and i cannot find the lines where is the beauty in the beast we made why the frost in the summertime  and i call the kids on the telephone say there is something wrong out here it is july but it is cold as christmas in the middle of the year  the temperature is up to ninety five but

sunrise they had gunned the rebels down as their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town there were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach there was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete when the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind take it home, take it low, take responsibilities came the message from the front for the captains, captains quarters must retreat pack the compass, pack the tents, take the banks they just called it down in history but they kept their uniforms they put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms for it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best that god had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest on the plains above the rock face where the sculpture eagles swoop there is a haunted yell for action among the spectre of his troops it was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced with the sound of retreating football from his military camp it is a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle crime sits heavy on the city shoulder ca not get no work, i ca not get a job i just sit and play my radio in the parking lot well they are breaking down doors in foreign countries everybody thinks somebody is hiding something there is talk on the street and the nation is worried but you ca not talk back when you are dead, when you are dead and buried  and everybody is restless everybody is scared everybody is looking for something that just ai not there everybody is restless  everybody is scared, they think we are all in danger everyone is taking cover from someone else is anger the walls have ears, big brother is watching they tell us that we are poisoned from everything that we are touching well we could be children from the way we are acting we feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action we just breed and we lose our nerve and there is bombs going off in every corner of the world hey there, george got a couple of things to say one, you are my friend, and two, it is hurting me seeing you act this way but my hands are tied and i can only try to talk you out of a fall

brown eyes and a body that could stop a clock but if you think your face ai not gonna be replaced george, boy, you are in for a shock  well, it is not my job to rain on your parade but if the chips were down you would do the same for me it is always been that way she is got you paralysed with a pack of lies about honour and the single girl and if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind you must be living in another world there is a light on in your window there is a shadow on the street two silhouette tell me it is over the shadow knows that shadow is me i wo not crawl i caused you trouble well that is the last thing i will ever do but before i leave your life completely tell me who wears these shoes, darling lord knows the days just get longer the nights grow cold with you on

to say that boys are tough as nails in every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail now things have changed, i feel so old like any girl could drag my heart across the goals i was always there in the thick of things i always had the heart of every woman on a string the danger zone shone from my eyes it seemed like every inch i gained became a mile  it is not the night reaching in and touching me it is just that breaking hearts ai not what it used to be it seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me and breaking hearts ai not what it used to be it is not the light shining in and catching me it is just that breaking hearts ai not what it used to be but time has come and cast a spell on me and breaking hearts ai not what it used to be  and now i know what lonely means i used to give so little and gain everything the darkest part of every day is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away ca not say i blame them all for being hurt after all i treated each and every one like dirt who wants a heart that is never home i face the facts and lock myself into a life alone she looked so easy because she looked so young with a gaisha smile made in taiwan she got cherry bombs inside her eyes and the luck of the irish on her side do not let her tell you that she loves your mind she is got her price, she can turn on a dime those crocodile tears ai not tears of pain look a little closer, that is acid rain  and i do not know why little refrigerator you are so cold go little refrigerator go get away from my soul little refrigerator you are so cold  she is calculated with the kiss of death got a digital mind and expensive breath she is an empty shell, you are a piece of meat just another statistic on her breakout sheet deny the passenger, who want to get on  want to get on he want to get on want to get on he want to get on  to make a chain of fools you need a matching pair one hypocritical fool and a crowd that is never there there is anger in the silence there is wheels upon the jail a black train built of bones on a copper rail  company conductor you need the salt of tears falling on a ticket that no one is used in years non-commercial native it is tattooed in your veins you are living in a blood bank and riding on this train  the spirit is free, but you always find passengers stand and wait in line someone in front and someone else behind but passengers always wait in line lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon behind the counter she states out the window up at the billboard that is like a reminder in neon  she hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon for two cents of danger she would trust anybody she would smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up  in neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies a shimmering city, a swimmer of hope and a lie in neon the name is gone there is no reason why anymore trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door  in neon  pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon a hot cup of coffee held in her fingers a perfect complexion that singers above her in neon it used to be a sweet sensation no price too high for love now i pay for this bitter taste and the price is not enough such cruel sport for your kicks such hard knocks on my heart how long before the pain ends tell me where living starts  and lovers leap off burning buildings waking up on a sky high wire desperation leaves us clinging on the edge of a house on fire lovers leap off burning buildings live our life on borrowed time every flame that ever moved you touched your lips but never mine lovers leap off burning buildings  no room for conversation cold states and angry words fall in pieces from our faces we read "do not disturb" some lovers just go hungry others beg for just a bite you use me under pressure to when your appetite sling your hook in with him baby he is a real sharp-shooter now if he is out there hiding in the tall grass tell him i said he was a coward this ai not any old western honey it is the twentieth century now but if he thinks he is some kind of tough cowboy and he is hurt her then i want to know how  did he shoot her with his compromise like a heart attack he can paralysed or did he hang her in a noose on the telephone line did he shoot her with a 45 did he leave his mark right between her eyes oh did he shoot that girl that used to be mine  tell him i am ready any time he chooses the pay-off for the things, for the things he is done he ai not messing with no two-bit bandit armed with a couple of guns if he wants to see it as a two reel movie he is living in the head of someone else but better take him down and dust him honey i want to hear the truth for myself  did he shoot her guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain and ironic' out the rough spots is

paris we will paint all our portraits in brush-strokes of yellow and christian the canvas the left bank is crying for colour to crown it like the roof of a palace we will drink in the amber when i get to paris you were the best of montmartre street life you signed the tablecloth art has its price it is so hard to hold on to the ghost of your breed it takes ambition to call the colours you need without you i no longer swim upstream where are you when i try to fill the spaces in between the red letter days and all the pain and while i remain shipwrecked everything has changed and i fall apart with this threat of decision hanging in my heart this house can get so lonely when the day grows dark and it seems to be the night time when i fall apart ca not you tell the shadows no longer comfort

the leading man he said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere and the words he spoke in spanish brought the female lead to tears a word in spanish, a word in spanish  if you ca not comprehend read it in my eyes if you do not understand it is love in a thin disguise and what it takes to move you each time that you resist is more than just a pretty face to prove that i exist  when manners make no difference and my gifts all lay undone i trade my accent in on chance and fall back on a foreign tongue i used to think that new york city fell from grace with god and innocence abroad waged a war for the underdog when the snow falls and central park looks like a christmas card i just looked beyond the batman and the madness that makes this city hard i heard a basketball somewhere out beyond a chain link fence inner city prisoners argue for the right of self defense but there is a fast break and every work of art wakes something in the soul just focus on the brush strokes and the bouquet

man grows bitter we are a bitter race some of us never get to see a better place in the northern skies there was a steel cloud it used to follow me around but i do not see it now there is a farm in the rain and a little farmhouse there were a young man is eyes looking south  the north was my mother but i no longer need her you trade your roots and your dust for a face in the river  and a driven rain that washes you to a different shore there is a north in us all but my north ca not hold me anymore she may be lost she may be out of bounds all her tenderness and charms could be something a man like me has never found but in her woman is way she is still a little girl the things that she wants, the things that she needs oh well the choice is hers  because you ca not take a woman when she does not want you and you ca not be a man if you are blind to reason man might be strong but true love is stronger you gotta play it straight when a woman does not want you  her voice invites her eyes say more than words but her needs and complications can tear away the memory of last night is girl and if you are weak yeah we are all weak sometime the best things can wait the best times they come oh when strength is kind  and if you ca not read her leave her alone and if you do not know by now she is not someone is prize and you ca not take her home the church bells ring out morning glory when summer bends to the winter is rage emily walks through the cemetery passed a dog in an unmarked grave the old girl hobbies, nylon tagging talks to her sisters in the ground i saw a lie in the mirror this morning i heard a prophecy all around  and emily they come and go the shadows and the distant sounds but emily do not be afraid when the weight of angels weighs you down  emily prays to a faded hero in a little frame clutches to her gown hears the voice of promise in his memory tonight is the night they let the ladder down in a cage sits a gold canary by a wicket chair and a rosewood loom as a soul ascends aboard the evening canary sings to an empty room i am staring down a mile of disappearing track is this the best that we could do i am leaning through the rain but you ai not looking

lost living on dark street looking for an exit sleeping on the concrete you ca not see it with your eyes you ca not find it with your feet all i know is that we are lost baby and we are living on dark street  all the layoffs and the pay cuts crippled me inside i pay the price for living everyday trying to keep us all together along with a little pride what will it take to make you stay but i have dreamed about an island and all i got is a bucket of sand i would give my eyes to give you all your dreams now i get to see my family slipping through my hands rolling over trying to sleep and understanding women thinking of you out there somewhere looking for a new beginning  just let me be the final word in the book we have not written i wo not be another page in understanding women  i

understanding women and i am not just anyone who ever stood outside your door and i am not any man you have ever known before do not judge this picture by the frame every man is not the same some men reach beyond the pain of understanding women yesterday you came to lift me up as light as straw and brittle as a bird today i weigh less than a shadow on the wall just one more whisper of a voice unheard tomorrow leave the windows open as fear grows please hold me in your arms wo not you help me if you can to shake this anger i need your gentle hands to keep me calm  because i never thought i would lose i only thought i would win i never dreamed i would feel this fire beneath my skin i ca not believe you love me i never thought you would come i guess i misjudged love between a father and his son  things we never said come together the hidden truth no longer haunting me tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken that kind of understanding sets me free  because i never thought i would lose i only thought i would win i never dreamed i would feel this fire beneath my skin i ca not believe you love me i never thought you would come i guess i misjudged love between a father and his son looking back in anger on this dirty little town it stained your dress carved up my face put a wedge between our state of grace something so young and pretty should never be released we place our bets we take our pick they wind up in the belly of the beast and when you ca not get what you want you take anything you can so i wear this suit of wolves at night i slip it on how come

like me  i need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice one man to show me the best part of life is that what you want yeah, that is what i need  a home and a family makes sense for us a solid foundation built out of trust do you think you can find that with someone like me two arms to hold you, one place to be are just some of the things that a woman needs  i have been shortchanged and cheated so many times but you are all that i have wanted for all of my life i have searched for the reasons, known how i have felt but what can i give you when i ca not trust myself  two arms to hold you, one place to be are just some of the things that a woman needs i want to be good, i want to be strong but i treated him bad, i have done him wrong i have taken his money, i am given him hell and he takes it all 'cause he knows me well we can say what we mean and mean what we say we do not like to mess around but we are there to hold each other up when we are falling down  just like an old friend putting me on my feet again giving me back my pride then letting me go  just like an old friend putting me in my place again giving me back my hope then letting me know that he is an old friend  i do not suffer no fools, i testify but he must be one for being by my side i have broken his heart, i have shaken his tree but still he does not want anything from a fool like me we wo not talk for a year or two maybe when we do, we wo not say much even so we know that out of mind is never out of touch  we are having a man-to-man do not want to get sentimental but both of us understand we will never have to say goodbye, just see you later  just like an old friend putting me in my place again giving me back my hope then letting me know on and on  she broke my heart, he hurt me too that is something that only unworthy souls do they said goodbye, we say hello an introduction for a perfect love to grow  let is stop thinking about the past and start thinking about the future so that love can go on and on  she said she would stay, he said that too so sad when you find out your love has found a new she made me cry, he made me keep but life has love in store for us that is ooh so sweet  on and on love keeps going on on and on they have got the whole of life on and on love keeps going on on and  it is time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams and get back to the joy that to

brightness go from blue to grey you know that is true you can shake your head but i can prove i have seen things through your eyes you think you win but in the end you lose  and there is no second guess we take no second bets chances are we are a long way from happiness do not cover up the road to love with words that ca not express the truth implies you are high and dry and you are a long way from happiness  i am one step behind looking out for you all the time i will put my faith in you and steer you clear of love that leaves you blind i ca not control this flesh and blood that is wrapped around my bones it moves beneath me, like a river into the great unknown i stepped onto the moving stairs before i could tie my shoes tried a harp out the fingers of a renegade who lived and died the blues  and his promise made was never clear it just carved itself in me all i saw was frost inside my head on the night he said to me  someday, we will live like horses free rein from your old, iron fences there is more ways than one to regain your senses break out the stalls, and we will live like horses  we are the victims of the heartbreak that kept us short of breath trapped above these bloodless streets without a safety net i stood in line to join the trial one more customer of fate claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train on the road to the golden gate  on the flat, dry desert, i jumped ship it just made sense to me i have spent too long in the belly of the beast and now, i shall be free  someday, we will live like horses free rein from your old, iron fences there is more ways than one to regain your senses break out the stalls, and we will live like horses someday  free rein from your old, iron fences there is more ways than one to regain your senses break out the stalls, and we will live like horses and when we start we say forever we say we care, we need, we feel you read the movement of our eyes but in our hearts we still believe the end will come, before we know the silent rule of love applies we light the fuse and let it burn out we just accept that love must die  and so they say "the end will come for us" and so the world slows down to let us off just hang it up and let it go, accept it if i must aa but i do not believe, i do not believe, that the end will come for us aa no i wo not believe the end will come for us  the end will come like sudden rain the end is never what it seems we sink the ship before we sail we just accept what failure means  and so they say "the end will come for us" and so the world slows down to let us off just hang it up and let it go, accept it if i must aa but i do not believe, i do not believe, that the end will come for us aa no i wo not believe the end will come for us  and so they say, "the end will come for us" and so the world slows down to let us off just hang it up and let it go, accept it if i must aa but i do not believe, i do not believe, that the end will come for us aa just hang it up

talk with god sitting in the great unknown watching all the lovers in the world get together sitting in heaven all alone  and we were love is knot after summer tied together in the dead of winter wrapped up with spring fever in the air bound together in the autumn every month means a little something but january is the month that cares  must have kissed you until i hurt you must have been a wild night must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day rag dolls in the morning' light must have found a secret place hiding in our own world must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips every single sound we heard take me for granted, i think that i could stand it after all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding  and you wait, and you wonder will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder? will she still be the star and see me through? because i ca not

on the surface the dog days marked and the house cat got old we were bonnie and clade in the emperor is new clothes  and the tears never came they just stayed in our eyes we refused to admit that we wore this disguise every inch of us growing like pinocchio is nose as we walked around in the emperor is new clothes  we flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants in the state of illusion in the nation of chance and the repo was hauling the wreck we would been driving as the dashboard madonna sailed back at us kindly we cheated the system never batting an eyed seeing only the good through the holes in our shoes and our halls were rusty but we wore them proudly we were two little gods in the emperor is new clothes  we were bonnie and clade in the emperor is new clothes  emperor is new clothes oh, i am a dark diamond i have turned hard and cold once was a jewel with fire in my soul there is two sides of a mirror one i could not break through stayed trapped on the inside, wound up

wall is built and the heart gardens you get a dark diamond dark diamond  oh, i am a dark diamond but you are something else you read me more than i read myself the one star i could count on only comet i could trust you burnt through my life to the true meaning of love i will take a rainy day to make a champagne shower coach some horn and tusk to build an ivory tower been to philadelphia the day it

much doubt been there drinking on that front porch angry kids, mean and dumb looks like a painting, that blue skyline god hates tags where we come from  'western skies' do not make it right 'home of the brave' do not make no sense i have seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire left to die on a high ridge fence it is a cold, cold wind it is a cold, cold wind it is a cold wind blowing, wyoming  see two coyotes run down a deer hate what we do not understand you pioneers give us your children but it is your blood that stains their hands somewhere that road forks up ahead to ignorance and innocence

on a high ridge fence it is a cold, cold wind it is a cold, cold wind it is a cold wind blowing, wyoming  somewhere that road forks up ahead to ignorance and innocence three lives drift on different

this place  i ca not eat, ca not sleep still i hunger for you when you look at me that face, those eyes all the sinful pleasures deep inside  tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in underneath my skin oh you were always my original sin and tell me why, i shoulder inside, every time we begin this dangerous game oh you were always my original sin  a dream will fly the moment that you open up your eyes a dream is just a riddle ghosts from every corner of your life up in the balcony all the romeo is are bleeding for your hand blowing theater kisses reciting lines they do not understand there is some things i do not have now some things i do not talk about these things are between myself and i in my thick skull the joker hides there is consequences i am scared to taste cold hard truths i ca not face these days are different than the past reflections change in the looking glass and everywhere i look there is something to learn a silver of truth from every bridge we burn a hateful of quarters and a naked song do not answer the question of where we belong  how come birds do not fall from the sky when they die? how come birds always look for a quiet place to hide these words ca not explain what i feel inside? like birds i need a quiet place to hide  these independent moves i make this confidence i try to fake you can hear the beating of my heart but not a feather falling in the dark and everything i hear never makes any sense another old prophet perched on the fence a cupful of pencils and a self help guru do not answer the question of what i am to you i want love, but it is impossible a man like me, so irresponsible a man like me is dead in places other men feel liberated  and i ca not love, shot full of holes do not feel nothing, i just feel cold do not feel nothing, just old scars toughening up around my heart  but i want love, just a different kind i want love, wo not break me down wo not brick me up, wo not fence me in i want a love that do not mean a thing that is the love i want, i want love  i want love on my own terms after everything i have ever learned may, i carry too much baggage oh man, i have seen so much traffic  but i want

the things i have done, the places that i have been this life of mine seemed surreal at times wasted days and nights in someone else is mind could it be i am not for real? i have slapped my face to check out how i feel there is hostages to prove it is true who lives behind the mask was never proved  come on robert johnson though we are worlds apart you and i know what it is like with the devil in our heart you sold your soul at the crossroads kept a little of mine on hand i am wading out this muddy water been stranded in the wasteland  battling chains all around my bed ghosts can laugh but they are already dead i am not dying and i am far from gone the blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on i am stoned in the twilight screaming on the inside give me your water, help me survive going to miss the sunlight when i lose my eyesight give me my red shoes, i want to dance they search for an answer but that old man would not listen back then i was handsome back then he was ignorant  and shave off the years now, it is all inside my head the boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer take my red shoes, i ca not wear them anymore  had garland in the wings back then all the pretty little things back then calling out my name, oh what fame brings after curtain calls and bows i ca not see the front row now hand me my red shoes just one more time they pushed aside our presence they refused to go the distance back then i was sigmund back then he would not listen  they pushed aside our presence they refused to go the distance back then i was sigmund back then he would not listen  put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer take my red shoes, i ca not wear them anymore i ca not wear them anymore you can take her make her change her name you and your old money dance around the flame but you can never, never love her like me you can charm her calm her when she is wild show a little comfort play with her inner child but you can never, never love her like me  so i just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week you may have her in real world but if you could only see how we rock this room in the twilight zone and you can never, never love her like me  you can warm her charm her with your style i know you convinced her she is the love of your life and no, you will never, never love her like me you can bless her keep her conscience clean you can address her go all the places i have been but you will never, never love her like me it is a case i guess of paradise lost ten years back on the hands of the clock in that little house on mansfield on your old block sometimes the magic of the past is all we have got just you and me at a crossroads then is not it funny how we were old friends accidentally thrown together did we intend to be the romantic novel you never want to end  and it is the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room and how i kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune you said, 'funny but it feels like i have known you all my life and how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight  in between the star of david and the california moon the santa ana winds blew warm into your room we were crazy, wild and running blind to the change to come in that little house on mansfield we would wake at the break of dawn in an indian summer gone  in the candlelight i can recall your naked shadow looking ten feet tall like a wild pony dancing along the wall off balance i found love the only place to fall  we would wake at the break of dawn in an indian summer gone you may not believe it but i do not believe in miracles anymore and when i think about it i do not believe i ever did for sure all the things i have said in songs all the purple prose you bought from me reality is just black and white the sentimental things i would write never meant that much to me  i used to be the main express all steam and whistles heading' west picking' up my pain from door to door riding' on the storyline, furnace burning' overtime but this train do not stop this train do not stop this train do not stop there anymore  you do not need to hear it but i am dried up and sick to death of love and if you need to know it i never really understood that stuff all the stars and bleeding hearts all the tears that walled up in my eyes never meant a thing to me read 'em, as they say, and keep i never felt enough to cry  i used to be the main express all steam and whistles heading' west picking' up my pain from door to door riding' on the storyline, furnace burning' overtime but this train do not stop this train do not stop this train do not stop there anymore  when i say that i do not care it really means my engine is breaking' down the chief chips my heart again the granite cracks beneath my skin i rumble into pieces on the ground  i used to be the main express all steam and whistles heading' west picking' up my pain from door to door riding' on the storyline, furnace burning' overtime but this train do not stop this train do not stop this train do not stop there anymore  but this train do not stop this train do not stop this train do not stop there anymore oh yeah it is a little bit funny, this feeling inside i am not one of those who can easily hide i do not have much money, but, boy, if i did i would buy a big house where we both could live if i was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no or a man who makes options in a traveling show i know it is not much, but it is the best i can do my gift is my song, and this one is for you  and you can tell everybody this is your song it may be quite simple, but now that it is done i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind that i put down in words how wonderful life is while you are in the world  i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss well, a few of the verses, well, they have got me quite cross but the sun is been quite kind while i wrote this song it is for people like you that keep it turned on so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do you see, i have forgotten if they are green or they are blue anyway, the thing is, what i really mean yours are the sweets eyes i have ever seen  and you can tell everybody this is your song it may be quite simple, but now that it is done i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind that i put down in words how wonderful life is while you are in the world  i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind that i put down in words how wonderful life is while you are in the world i am weary and i am staying up late and the rain hits my roof so hard you know i am no longer thirty these days i am happy to play one or two hands of cards i hate flies in the kitchen buzzing disturbing the peace i have found fortune and fame is so fleeting these days i am happy to say i am amazed that i am still around  and the weight of the world is off my back when we fell, we got up and crawler out the cracks excuse me if i take some comfort in that happy today, happy to play with the weight of the world off of my back  humidity hangs like a curtain oh, it logs up my glasses sometimes you know i have still got my eyesight these days i am happy to see a sunset instead of a line  there is a long list of names that i do not recall even though my memory is good the rain washed away the demons and weeds when the weight of the world weighed more than it should i hate flies in the kitchen buzzing disturbing the peace i have found fortune and fame is so fleeting these days i am happy to say i am amazed that i am still around and the weight of the world is off my back when we fell, we got up and crawler out the cracks excuse me if i take some comfort in that happy today, happy to play with the weight of the world off of my back  happy today, happy to play with the weight of the world off of my back there is a porch swing in tulo in the shade of the south where the sweet honey drops off that

and there is no hope inside there is a chance you will find an answer in the sky well, they say that it is a shame if you have nothing to believe and if you ca not hold on to something you might as well die where you sleep you do not need a prayer and there is no price to ask why sometimes you will find an answer in the sky  and it is all so much bigger than it seems and it all overwhelm us now

is always in the cards i am on the road, sunrise is at my back lost it all somewhere between the cracks i always hoped that i would do better that i would come out on top for once we all get what we deliver then there are the lucky ones  and i have got all that i am allowed it will do for me, i am thankful now the walls get higher every day the barriers get in the way but i see hope in every cloud and i am thankful, thankful i am thankful, so thankful i am thankful, i have got all that i am allowed  leaving town gets to feel just like a job my desire never winds up on top i can say now i did not want the moon it is out of reach somewhere beyond this room i always hoped that i would do better that i would come out on top for once we all get what we are delivered then there are the lucky ones  ] i always try to make things clear then i watched as progress starts i only hope i am standing here when heaven finally comes to call we are still all right we took it on the chin but in the thirteenth hour no one ever wins but we are strong enough like traffic all tied up and when the static clears the radios still buzz  and i stop and i breathe because you wanted me and i wanted you so bad and i stop and i breathe because i still believe no one really knows what it is that we have  like blood in a vein we chased this one down and in the darkest long night we turned it all around and it was coal-ousted snow that covered the fields but the corn it still grew and the injury healed did you see the first man on the moon? have you seen the first light of day? when there was not someone stuck inside something like the moon something like a star that is lost its way did you go to dallas on that day? have you been to where they broke a dream? where there really is not room for doubt? somehow we got lost and the truth is buried somewhere in between  and everyone, everywhere take time and dry your eyes because too many tears, too many tears have been cried just look into that beautiful blue that beautiful blue, blue sky and know too many tears, too many tears have been cried  the mystery of why they had to leave i am only one of thousands saying why why a balcony in memphis, tennessee seems trapped in time just an angry finger pointing at the sky would you wait to stand inside his shoes? and is the best all you have to give the barefoot man lived a simple life i guess he knew some things die so other things might live it is getting dark in here do not want to leave shadow is falling and i believe winds picking up thing is so unclear i am afraid of my shadow and it is getting dark in here i am scared of strangers on the street world is so ugly i ca not breath moon is so spooky i am close to tears i have lost it all and it is getting dark in here  and the wait is not worth what i am getting sometimes i feel i am on fire i have been handed a curse and a blessing my life is been stripped down to the wire and i am trying to get back and hold on find someone somewhere who cares but the sun is always setting on my life and it is sure getting dark in here  do not talk about angels or how i will be saved i am no coward but i am not that brave rags are blowing rain is getting near i am done with running and it is getting dark in here  yeah, the sun is always setting on my life and it is sure getting dark in here i ca not keep this from you i have held it in so long it is time to tell the truth keeping it from you is wrong i ca not keep this from you it is so simple i am afraid when i tell you how i feel you will just laugh and call me crazy  and i ca not keep this love a secret and i do not want to go on longing i just want a chance for me to prove my love and i ca not keep this from you  i ca not keep this from you it is hard to

a music playing in your ear and i am listening, and i am listening and then i disappear  and then i feel a change like a fire deep inside something bursting me wide open impossible to hide and suddenly i am flying flying like a bird like electricity electricity sparks inside of me and i am free, i am free  it is a bit like being angry it is a bit like being scared confused and all mixed up and mad as hell it is like when you have been crying and you are empty and you are full i do not know what it is, it is hard to tell  it is like that there is some music playing in your ear but the music is impossible impossible to hear  but then i feel it move me like a burning deep inside something bursting me wide open impossible to hide and suddenly i am flying flying like a bird like electricity electricity sparks inside of me and i am free, i am free  electricity sparks inside of me and i am free, i am free oh, i am free we heard richard nixon say, “welcome to the usa” the common sense i sometimes lack has opened up a seismic crack we’ve fallen in and i can’t pull back and i guess we’ll have to stay in open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus twin spirits socking up a dream fuel to feed the press machine after years that were long and lean we’re finally on our way and richard nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas he’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way a little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do a small diversion caused by two pale kids come to play and we heard richard nixon say, “welcome to the usa” neither of us understood the way things picked in hollywood we just loaded in and grabbed the bat with little room to swing a cat and pretty soon we were “where it’s at” or so the papers say and all around us sustained teens, beauty like we’d never seen our heroes led us by the hand through brian wilson’s promised land where disney’s god and he commands both mice and men to stay and richard nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas he’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way a little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do a small diversion caused by two pale kids come to play and we heard richard nixon say, “welcome to the usa” in a bright red porsche on sunset i saw steve queen i guess he’s just about the coolest guy i’ve ever seen and for you and me that speeding car is how it’s going to be i see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline oh, we heard richard nixon say, “welcome to the usa” the common sense i sometimes lack has opened up a seismic crack we’ve fallen in and i can’t pull back pale kids come to play and we heard richard nixon say, “i’ve gotta go but you can stay” pale kids come to play and we heard richard nixon say, “i’ve gotta go but you can stay” it is just like noah is ark there is two of every kind pretty girls and boys in drag walking a fine thin line shaking hands and busting cheeks linking their lips like they could eat me alive in a couple of weeks yea just like noah is ark italiano promotion men chopping a big cigar slapping backs and making cracks about the tags in the bar radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet you put it out son and we will all back it yea it is just like noah is ark  and the waves are crashing round us but we are ready for the flood and we do not need a sign like an olive branch in the beak of a snow white dove we are not as dumb as we might look you ca not keep us in the dark with me and you it is two by two just like noah is ark  these four walls have seen the corvettes and the masters from san francisco to ohio i have seen beauty and disaster rocky young rosters and little chicks flashing smiles, shaking them hips trying to hook it up for the late night shift here in noah is ark  and we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage all access to the liars who claim they wrote a page but for every tiny dancer there is a dog that is had its day the truth is never quite the same as what the papers say i remember it like it was yesterday snow in the park and skaters on the ice long black cars standing side-by-side loading up the boys at night turned up our collars to the chill of the wind caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights not something you would see on a new york street it is such an uncommon sight  but i would not have it any other way this city is got a thing about it, do not try to understand it new york city i would really like to stay new york city i would not have you i would not have you any other way  oh the subway rumble underneath italian lights where joey gallon died and the man on the door down at 54 is letting only the pretty inside i would wake with a stranger under the covers late in the day and longing for the night just like the snowfall there is so many bodies but somehow it feels so right  and i can feel the magic and read a million lips and no matter what might happen they will never sink this ship nostradamus said, "i predict that the world will end at half past six" what he did not say was exactly when was he listening to the radio? was he listening to the government? well he got us looked anyway we would been running hot up until today but a wind of change blew across our sales we were casting on a winning streak we were kings until the power failed  we have been living in a tinderbox and two sparks can set the whole thing off rubbing up together around the clock lately we have been getting more roll than rock you and me together in a tinderbox tinderbox two sparks can set the whole thing off rubbing up together around the clock lately we have been getting more roll than rock you and me together in a tinderbox  godzilla came in disguise tore the building down right before our eyes kept the needle out of the red balloon was he worried we might go too far maybe wind up rhyming moon and june the sun descends down in mexico while a fancy car back on save row shows the price of fame leads to overkill things are going to have to change some holes along the road get filled  pressure is going to cook us if we do not unlock it gun is going off if we do not unlock it we have got to climb out of the other one is pocket or we are going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket the sun is up and the shades are all pulled down i am more paranoid with every little sound like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around and a siren waiting on the other side of town oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head if i could think straight i would wish i was dead or curled up naked in my lover is bed instead i am hanging over hell suspended by a single thread  and i do not recall who said it at this time that your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind i built it up and the wolf he came around he suffer and pulled and the house fell down  with a rolled up note i am hovering on that line three days on a diet of cocaine and wine and a little weed just to level me sometime i put the clock in the drawer because i have cancelled out the time  so do not knock on my door, do not try to call i am holed up in this room talking to the wall when you are high as this you think you know it all when you are this deep in there is no place else to fall  and still that saying gets inside my mind that your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind i built it up and the wolf he came around he suffer and pulled and the house fell down he was not famous but i sure did love him i have got his picture in a little frame he lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name but there is so many more and i have lost count the how and why are not important now all that matters is they came around and frightened up our lives she was twenty one with her life ahead you do not need to know her name she breached her last on the cold stone floor of a hollywood arcade but fate is right hand is not always just puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust she was just a little girl is not that enough to rage against the day  and how did we get so lucky? targets on the rifle range who makes the call and who gets to choose? who gets to win and who gets to lose? it is like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues and blues never fade away hey hey the colors run when the rain falls but blues never fade away  he shone so bright with a lust for life like the sun king that he was his passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth and for reasons i never understood about the choices made between the bad and good i have tried to figure out but the pain never goes away  and there is marble markers and little white crosses along the beaten path and i have spread their ashes on the wind and i miss john lennon is laugh i have seen the bridge and the bridge is long and they built it high and they built it strong strong enough to hold the weight of time long enough to leave some of us behind  and every one of us has to face that day do you cross the bridge or do you fade away and every one of us that ever came to play has to cross the bridge or fade away  standing on the bridge looking at the waves seen so many jump, never seen one saved on a distant beach your song can die on a bitter wind, on a cruel tide  and the bridge it shines oh cold hard iron saying come and risk it all or die trying i am no longer counting i am not keeping score i could say my list of lovers does not matter anymore but some are always in my heart and some i am not so sure either way they all left their mark and for some i found a cure  from one you learn something another you learn, nothing and there is one who might teach you everything but before i learned to listen and if indeed someone said it then i guess i must have lost it on the wind  back when i was younger each one was a prize love just came along and hit you right between the eyes and one was just a trophy catch and one was like a curse some would want to bleed you dry some might bench your thirst  in cold water i went fishing in warm seas i cast a line and swore the heart i was reeling in was perfect at the time you could not tell me i was wrong, you could not tell me anything and if you did then i guess i must have lost it on the wind hey how about this a little conversation tonight thinking aloud how we struggled to find our place in the diary heights do not often do this we never really get the chance nearly froze to death on oxford street now we are sitting in the south of france talking through the evening it is good to shoot the breeze just you and me on a balcony and canadas singing in the trees  old '67 what a time it was what a time of innocence, what a time we have lost raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two here is to old '67 and an older me and you  sentimental twilight converting on those virgin days laughing about how the two of us sound like a tennessee williams play honest, it is amazing that we can get together at all for in between the saddle and the grand piano we can read the writing on the wall talking through the evening sitting here side by side just you and me on a balcony it is a little bit funny this feeling inside i have been out here on this road some ca not help feeling i have been shown' my friends around i have seen it growing' from next to nothing' into a giant, eating' up your town called up the tea leaves and the tarot asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah she saw a mountain and wild deer running' a crazy kid becoming a better man  but we stuck around for the fireworks waiting' to explode shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed and me on a yellow brick road pleasing' the people some of the time for better or for worse an urban soul in a fine, silk suit and a heart out west in a rangle shirt  and you ca not go back and if you try, it fails looking' up ahead i see a rusty nail a sign hanging' from it saying', "truth for sale" and that is what we did no lies at all, just one more tale about the captain and the kid  we have been missing', at times, in action ca not imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah the devil got to come to the party sometimes but he never got to wear our shoes oh, we have injured up what we created way back then, when i was standing' up in six-inch heels now you are riding' off into the sunset and i am still spinning' like a catherine wheel  but we stuck around for the battle waiting' for a plan to turn you into the brown dirt cowboy and me into a rocket man it pleases the people some of the time digging' into our roots but i got a brand new pair of shoes and you are on a horse in old cowboy boots  and you ca not go back and if you try, it fails looking' up ahead i see a rusty nail a sign hanging' from it saying', "truth for sale" and that is what we did no lies at all, just one more tale about the captain and the kid  no, you ca not go back and if you try, it fails looking' up ahead i see a rusty nail a sign hanging' from it saying', "truth for sale" and that is what we did no lies at all, just one more tale about the captain and the kid i knew from the first night i met you something just was not quite right loving like an innocent stranger but something was just out of sight  how could i know that you had used me fill out some plan of your own i could have known you would abused me leave me here hurt and alone  if it was not for you i would be happy if it was not for lies you would be true i know that you could be just like you should if it was not for bad you would be good  i only sung what i wanted to sing you were a dream in my mind i never know how you never could be it did not take long for me to find i guess that it is mine for foresee only what i wanted to see i could not know you would be a player just acting for me  if it was not for bad you would be good you had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate the winter of your discontent came twenty years too late if it was love and i was there i have forgotten where it lives we both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge you came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing reading the rewards of the fable you would been sowing i saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs like cesar crossed the rubin you seemed to walk on air  yea i have seen your movie and i read it in your book the truth just flew off every page your songs have all the hooks you are seven wonders rolled in one you shifted gear to cruise oh you came to town in headlines and eight hundred dollar shoes  oh the bellboys are crying and money changing hands your cloak and dagger legacy is gone home to no man is land the marquee lights are bickering your poster is fading fast your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass  oh you came to town in headlines and eight hundred dollar shoes it is a constant struggle getting up that hill there is a change of guard every day when you are clinging onto a driftwood boat you pray a great white whale might come your way no freeway traffic in the frozen north just a chain link fence full of birds and when the maroon is loaded in the cannon bay you will be rolling through the pages lost for words  hey aab can you tell me where i can catch a ride out of here hey aab hoist that sail you gotta stand up straight when you ride that whale  in a crumbling city we were trapped for days with a broken sun above the clouds caught like jonas forty fathers down and a sign on the wall saying, "hope allowed" all the cryptic symbols carved on bone a far cry from a tattooed rose and when the boys in the rigging catch the wind we will all weigh anchor and it is westward ho luther left at first light friday morning little dan and beck wave good-bye they are gonna have to share the wait together idle hands will see a good fire slowly die  gone to sailor for the union shoulder to shoulder, side by side gone to sailor, hope springs eternal when flags and bullets start to fly  april is come and the air smells fresh with rain they watched his shadow fade around the bend he is headed for a different kind of thunder and the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men  gone to sailor for the union shoulder to shoulder, side by side gone to sailor, time passes slowly when flags and bullets start to fly  the old black rooster sang in death down that dirt road his steps in bold, his man of fancy free i pray we see him alive and well in the forehead in that godforsaken place in tennessee  gone to sailor for the union shoulder to shoulder, side by side gone to sailor, men stand united when flags and bullets start to fly  after all this, if we should prevail heaven help the south when sherman comes their way i am looking at a funeral wagon rolling down a two-lane highway winding past a desert town a big blue canvas painted by the master is hand the shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand in that mirror maybe that is what is left of me freezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel air them out is the best release and get some rest carrie do not wait up for me the baseman is going west  in this room all alone i dream of you in this drawer i found someone i never knew  now i pop a top and stay up late with video and fall asleep to visions of meridian i have seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads a black face barney showman scare a song to death in my short life i have seen as much as most men need now i am just looking for some cleaner air to breathe  now i pop a top and stay up late with video and fall asleep to visions of meridian  far away, far away so many years, so many days all along this broken land i have seen a lover is empty arms and hunger is empty hand there is no time for waiting no future to see inside the next moment nothing might be the answer is not certain no time to decide is this the last curtain? there is no place to hide  there is no tomorrow  there is only today  we all know the story we have heard it before we end up no question outside of death is door there is no easy answer to the question at hand so easy to ask and not understand  there is only today if you are looking for the glory you think that you might find in a bullet-riddled stolen car on a back road in the pines if it is round just like a medal on a tired old man of war or hidden like that burma star in my dad is bottom drawer  look at you in your monkey suit driving south, nothing left to prove you come back here in your cowboy boots dressed to kill in your monkey suit every pose you strike, every frame they shoot shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit  build your ladder to the moon beat on that sacred drum example on the hands of those that cling to every rung every seed you crush beneath like stone ground in a mill you never drew a decent breath but you are just dressed to kill i hear you singing, "i shall be released" like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece but that is all right, that is ok grab the bottle and slide my way you dreamed of a devil down below sprinkled cadence pepper in your sugar bowl but he is a fool and he is a thief got silly little horns and pointed teeth  roll back the covers and raise the shades we do not want to miss out on the best part of the day you are my best friend you shared my crazy ways now we do not want to miss out on the best part of the day  there is a canyon where an echo hangs like the ancient bells of notre dame it is beyond the hills out of sight thought i heard 'em ringing all last night hear the mating call of the morning dove like romeo angels in the roof above rains will come sweet and clean let the tears of god keep the mountains green  one big sun coming up old moon going down thunder breaking in the east i am going to love you until it comes around  you are my best friend you shared my crazy ways now we do not want to miss out on the best part of the day i can hear your heart pounding in my ear now i feel the sound and the time is near i feel the taste of all the things you do now the time has come i know you are a dream come true you make me so complete with the things you do and the music is sweet you make me feel brand new i hear the sound songs start coming through somehow i know that you are a dream come true  it takes my breath when it sounds that way seems like you chase the clouds away and i feel so good each and every day and life is good each and every way  now i feel the beat of the dancing drums and now i know we are going to have some fun now the time stands still and the blues are through and now i know what i am going to do they say we cruise too easily i do not know if it is that way for me i have seen them come, i have seen them go i have seen everyone i know fall in and out of love it is just the way it goes word is out, silence seems so loud there is no light above or below me now i have seen it grow, i have seen it live i have seen everything i give falling out my hands, no matter who i am with  and nobody ever tells you when love is dying, when love is dying it just gets a little colder and we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying oh when love is dying  there is a pain you never can explain cuts so deep time and time again i felt it then, i feel it now but nobody told me how to fight a world of hurt somebody help me now  but love never gets to show you and i never got to know you no we never stood a chance when love was dying no and love never makes it easy and i never got that feeling no we never stood a chance when love was dying are you standing outside? looking up at the sky nursing a wondering star well if i were you i would throw rocks at the moon i would say damn you wherever you are i do not know where to start this cage around my heart locked up what i would meant to say or i felt all along the way just wondering how come i could not take your breath away  because i never sent roses i never did enough i did not know how to love you though i loved you so much when i should have sent roses when you crossed my mind no other reason than the fact you were mine i should have sent roses  looking back on my life oh, if fate should decide i could do it all over again i would build no more walls i would stay true and recall the fragrance of you on the wind you will get better than me someone who can see right from the start given all that you need i will slip away knowing i am half the man i could be  yeah should have sent roses i am out here in the darkness i hear the bowling wind sometimes i sit and wonder will i ever see love again looking for an answer not an easy thing to find out here in the wilderness with questions on my mind now the sun is rising higher in the sky the morning light is crawling from the darkness of the night the raindrops keep on falling there is no light of day the sadness deep inside me does not seem to go away  and there is no way out. no road home i am lost in doubt and i am all alone the time has come when love is done hearts have finally turned to stone  no more bright tomorrow, only sad today my heart is filled with sorrow the pain wo not go away try to keep from crying all night long and through the day lost and all alone hearts have finally turned to stone do not abandon life do not step away do not give up that tune that you never could play if you are folding your tent and the gas pipes grown if every bone battles through nights all alone well you are tougher than leather no old burial sack not some hard scramble weeds growing up through the cracks  do not you know, you are never too old you are never too old to hold somebody do not you know, you are never too old you are never too old to hold somebody  do not think you have gone out do not flicker and fade if you are going to get demons then do what they say the wind makes you weary it knocks you around logs on the fire beats sun shining down but you are harder than nails no skinny old tack you are still sharp as a razor and i like you like that  i could bet on a horse but i am betting on you you still got what it takes you got nothing, nothing to prove well i could have been sick i could have died i could have given up and not tried to make it to tomorrow like a broken hearted lover but there was a brand new start and suddenly i was taken new and parkway places and the music i was shaken it was a whole new race when i woke on that first day there was nothing i could say i was in the hands of angels johnny and the governor came and brought me to my senses they made me feel just like a king made me lose all my bad defenses  and they knew all the places i needed to go all of the people i needed to know they knew who i needed and who needed me and who would come help me and who would just let me be  i was in the hands of angels until this very day inside the hands of angels what more can i say when you are in the hands of angels life is oh so sweet and you feel the love down deep inside even out there on the street  in the hands of angels i hung out with the old folks in the hope that i would get wise i was trying to bridge the gap between the great divide  hung on every recollection in the theater of their eyes picking up on this and that in the few that still survived  call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine the ones who hold onto the the ones they had to leave behind those that flew and those that fell the ones that had to stay beneath a little wooden cross oceans away  they bend like trees in winter these stuffing old grey lions those snow-white stars still gather like the belt around orion  just to touch the faded lightning of their powerful design of a generation gathering for maybe the last time  call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine the ones who hold onto the the ones they had to leave behind those that flew and those that fell the ones that had to stay beneath a little wooden cross oceans away  oceans away where the green grass says and the cool wind blows across the shadow of their graves shoulder to shoulder back in the day sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away oceans away  call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine the ones who hold onto the the ones they had to leave behind those that flew and those that fell the ones that had to stay beneath a little wooden cross oceans away freedom for the scapegoat leaving reading jail rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails shaking fists and razor gleaned you never stood a chance when the ink ran red on fleet street you turned your eyes to france  humble far from dublin, chased across the waves your biting wit still sharp enough to slice through every page destitute and beaten by the system of the crown the bitter pill you swallowed tasted sweater going down  and looking back on the great indifference looking back at the limestone walls thinking how beauty receives you knowing how love fools us all  a golden boy in velveteen landed in new york the past was so seductive when they paid to hear you talk baccarat and champagne flutes tobacco from virginia long before the lords and law branded oscar wide a sinner  and looking back on the cold bleak winter looking back on those long dark days felt like the head of john the baptist in the arms of some  do not turn around it is a white gull screaming do not cry out loud you never know who is listening you have seen it all the exiled forgiven from the stately homes of england to her prisons and looking back at the hardened liners looking back on the wretched poor thinking maybe they were my savior strange to think i will miss them all strange to think i will miss them all lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk said

introduce you to my final stand i went to paris once i thought i had a plan i woke up with an accent i wound up in quicksand my quicksand  i was full of foreign notions at the start there was never once when i was off my guard for any ghost of every poet in the ground there is one like me to buy the guys a round  my quicksand let me introduce you to my final stand i went to paris once i thought i had a plan i woke up with an accent i wound up in quicksand my quicksand  i am going down you and me together going down it is not what i would been told about this town that when you least expect

quicksand my quicksand my quicksand i blew the dust out of the corners threw some dead wood on the fire tuned the radio to silence watched the evening sun expire should have called you up this morning but i am such a fool at times i still search my shaving mirror looking for your face with mine  and i ca not stay alone tonight ca not let another day go by why is it always this way? time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i ca not stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i ca not stay alone tonight  chalk up one more crazy notion imagination running wild but if i needed confirmation i would have gone that extra mile you are the last chance on the highway i am that open stretch of road you are the diner in my rear-view a cup of coffee getting cold  and i ca not stay alone tonight ca not let another day go by why is it always this way? time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i ca not stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i ca not stay alone tonight  bruised in this cold war of words we have come undone two loose ends alone possessed by that curse you have endured the spell that i cast could not make you come home  and i ca not stay alone tonight ca not let another day go by why is it always this way? time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i ca not stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i ca not stay alone tonight i am looking, i am looking back i am trying to imagine this and that the simple mathematics making up the map insurance of protection from immediate collapse i am watching, i am watching you a voter from a different point of view the solitary eyes that i have been looking through committed to connecting the old ways to the new and i see things through a curtain blowing back against the rain through the crack in a door that leaves with pain and through every gap that gives away some secret in the dark i will come away with something to keep you in my heart i am searching, i am setting out to prove without a shadow of a doubt the age-old contradiction that is hovering about a whisper in the darkness holds more truth than a shout i am waiting, i am waiting for telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor a broken hearted lover simply looking for relief that is temporary from her dirty little war and i see things from the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms from a satellite that is bouncing off the moon and from every telescope that is focused in on someplace dark i will come away with something to keep you in my heart yes i see things from the highest branch that looks directly in through a hawk is eyes gliding silent on the wind and in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park i will come away with something to keep you in my heart  voter i’m counting' on a memory to get me out here i’m waiting' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear all this time i’ve spent been' someone else’s friend just one more time, for old time’s sake, i’d like to go back home again  the world had seven wonders once upon a time it’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline and all around me, i’ve seen times like it was back when but like back then, i’d say men if i could get back home again  if i could go back home, if i could go back home if i’d never left, i’d never have known we all dream of leaving', but wind up in the end spending' all our time trying' to get back home again  could have been a jailbreak and the spotlight hitting' me or was i just some nightclub singer, back in 1963 in the old part of valencia on the coast of spain never tiin' once of hearing' songs about going' home again  if i could go back home, if i could go back home if i’d never left, i’d never have known we all dream of leaving', but wind up in the end spending' all our time trying' to get back home again  if i could go back home, if i could go back home if i’d never left, i’d never have known we all dream of leaving', but wind up in the end spending' all our time trying' to get back home again spare the rod do not spare the fool if you take the breaks you are given you get to make the rules take a chance and make it fast if you break some bones on landing you know you are built to last  fight the tide and find the shore if the gift horse is not smiling just learn to ride some more common sense is a rule of thumb if the sucker throw a red flag blow them all to kingdom come  and take this dirty water running like a river in and out of everything we helped to put together take this dirty water help to keep it clean get back to the wellspring purify the stream  search out days that never end if it is only for the chance to feel just like a child again tell a lie that speaks the truth if the heart becomes a prisoner your soul will turn you loose forgotten scars remind us of too much war, too little love beneath the fault-line truth to burn within the page so much to learn  wounded birds look to us who can heal? who to trust bring down the giants old and new strike up the band and waltz on through  i was shaking with a fever when the last good horse went down we were just a couple dancing where a thousand kings were crowned shaking with a fever before the white flag flew and the ballroom opened up to us and the dancers danced on through  love in ruins, torn apart victims of the careless heart skating on the cold grey ice before the flood toward the light  muddy boots to shiny shoes headlines screaming out the news from dirt and damp to hardwood floors beyond the burned out broken walls  and the dancers danced on through i carried you in my arms through the hotel to our room the night was filled with music those old historic tunes songs of revolution filled our hearts and fed our souls as the fireworks exploded like those cannons long ago  see the kids in the candlelight spirits on the mend every golden child tonight just changes on the wind see the kids in the candlelight see them shining bright innocence beyond the fight see the kids in the candlelight  five hundred wooden saints below the color is cracked and dry you said their stories should be told did they suffer when they died? give us your tradition give us hope and send us home we will be the cracked bells telling the voice of dust and
